I could tell pretty quickly that he was trying to escape through all these drugs and justifying it to himself bc he pretends it makes him a better person. Truth is the dude put drugs before his family when he was young and it even caused his wife to be alienated by HER family too. Now maybe their parents don\u2019t have a very open minded view on drugs but it\u2019s hard to support one of the biggest drug you tubers when the guy is your son or dating your daughter. I used to love Adam bc he seemed like the perfect specimen of the type of person we used to love to see commenting in this sub Reddit but after a while it wasn\u2019t hard to see his issues and how he was just trying to escape his problems. It takes one to know one\u2026 \n\nHe actually used to frequent this sub a very long time ago and a few people said they ended up banning him because he was super annoying and would act like he knew better than everyone else. Not sure if it was this sub or r/drugs but I\u2019m pretty sure it was this one. Somebody here probably knows what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nNow he\u2019s finally getting called out and people are starting to catch his patterns. Recently he has had colabs with with a guy named Derek in which he admitted to being addicted to kratom and has now hopped on testosterone to \u201chelp\u201d him with his kratom addiction. Didn\u2019t take long for Adam to say \u201cI mean I\u2019m loving the effects why not take more testosterone?\u201d \n\nI know this so well bc I unfortunately have a very similar mindset. Take this, take that, why not more, take too much, stop or find something else to counter the effects from taking too much. Any way I want to feel happy euphoric, awake, anxiety free, energy there\u2019s a perfect drug out there for it but I figured out not long ago that I was just as delusional as Adam. I think it\u2019s a good thing he\u2019s going sober but to backtrack on all his previous stuff is\u2026 idk.

I miss my kids so much and they miss me. Every short time I see them they end up in tears. Just yesterday my sweet boy cried and screamed and pissed his pants because his mother only allows me to spend very limited time with him and his sister and he did not want to leave. And I told him I dont want him to leave either, but we have to do what mommy believes is \"good\" until things change.

He's an addict moderation and control just isn't something he can manage.

I think it is the way he acts like hes a prestigious researcher but mostly regurgitates basic information read on PsychonautWiki.\n\nI dont know what to trust of what he says.

It's really sad to see especially when someone who's been a beacon of light in the harm reduction community from day one, how even the biggest advocates can go against their own advice from time to time. It's the nature of substances and the brain, nobody is immune from certain pre-dispositions they have towards substances. I do hope he can truly start his path to healing.

Negative allosteric modulators work in reverse, reducing affinity or efficacy or both. Neutral allosteric modulators don't do either, but block the allosteric binding site for other allosteric modulators, preventing modulation from taking place, and thus can be thought of as the allosteric versions of silent antagonists (whereas negative allosteric modulators are essentially allosteric versions of inverse agonists).\n\nBenzodiazepines are typically positive allosteric modulators of GABA receptors - actual agonists of GABA receptors tend to have different phenomenology and (for GABA receptor subtype A) include somnatives like muscimol and ibotenic acid, alongside Z-drugs like Zolpidem (Ambien).", "210": "It's more complicated than just agonising gaba, benzos are something called a positive allosteric modulator", "211": "How would you compare it to 3-meo-pcp?if you have experienced it of course.

Now at least the put some research about safety and efficiency at least ;)", "487": "I've moved to OTC codeine in Poland", "488": "I'm from Europe and just received a bunch of Flualp lol.", "489": "You can stil order flualp etiz and 3mmc very easily.", "490": "The US is about to make a bunch of those shed 1 so it will be super hard to get here", "491": "And now I\u2019m trying all kinds of way sketchier replacement for etiz (3-hydroxyphenazepam sound legit right?) and 3-mmc (tried 3-mec today, smells toxic af). \n\nThe ban probably made my drug use even more dangerous, nice \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "492": "Netherlands seems to still have rc", "493": "Lol imagine being German where almost all the good RC\u2019s are banned ducking hell sometimes I do stuff none of you Others ever heard about", "494": "Only a bit of bromazolam the rest is mostly hallucinogens like 4 aco dmt ,1p lsd ,MAL...", "495": "(Sorry for the wall of word, if no time, read only the 1st and last paragraphs that are about the ban, my recovery and the opportunity of the ban to be straight with my psychiatrist and withdraw slowly)  \n\n\nI personnaly turn the ban in NL as an opportunity to reinforce my recovery beginning : I decided to stop amphet-like drugs 2 weeks before the ban and go to Narcotics Anonymous as well as to go to church. The ban was almost a sign of God for me, no more temptation  if there's no product anymore.  \n\n\nAlso, about dangerous shits, and I mean benzos I took/take to balance my consumption of amph. Reality is the main problem wasn't amphet anymore but clonazolam I ate like tic-tac every 2 hours or so or every time I felt anxious, did something I thought would be anxious (put a foot out of my flat was enough to consider it as highly stressful moment in my day after I took amounts of amphet I didn't measure anymore, 4h-mph rails looked more like a cocaine one from Scarface at the end of the movie, repeated the dosage 5 to 6 time a day, far from the 15mg in the morning I used to weight precisely 2 months ago (tolerance of dopaminergic is so impressive but fast to decrease too). If too much people in the metro, I ate a pill. Then when the night came, I used flunitrazolam, saying to myself \"take some rest tonight not like last night you played Xbox, masturbates and it was 2pm already, just forgot to sleep\". So I took 4 at the same time and it did'nt work.   \n\n\nThe only thing that punched me in the face when I took crazy amount of amphets like that was 10 to 15mg of loxapine/Loxapac (typical anti-psychotic I'm prescribed \"if needed only\" now but I used to take 90mg a day at the hospital with another anti-psychotic and I kept hearing voices in my jead during 4 months after being sober of amphetamins which trigggered the psychosis) and I'm sleeping in less than 30min, even if I took a giant line of any amphetamine you might think 1 hour earlier. Problem : I am zombified the day after so I use it only when it's hihly needed (when I begin to have psychotic symptoms again or according to my social life, if I have to wake up early, I try to sleep the night before)  \n\n\nSorry, I lost myself in the writing but what I wanted to tell you was that I talked about the ban and my consumptions at my psychiatrist (specialized into addiction) and we decided to switch to the only and unique Valium/diazepam, precursors of all benzos, the treatment of substitution for benzos (and even alcoholic in my experience). We found a balanced dosage at 50mg per day, decreasing 5mg per 5mg every 10 days and I'm allowing myself to go 10 days or 2 weeks in a mental facility in order to not freak out when it will be time to decrease from 10mg to some drops they use at the hospital and when it will be time to go from 4 frops (1,3333mg) to nothing, especially since I made a diskynesia (because of the anti psychotics) alone at home when I believed I would die, the doctor of the ambulance became blank when he measures my tension which was at 24 and my sat 02 was so bad they used oxygen and a nurse was dedicated to calm me down and tell me to inspire and expire cause I could'nt on my own. So I don't want to risk a seizure alone at home, so I might go back to the hospital at the end.", "496": "Here there's a stash of benzos, just can't use them if I miss mmc and other stims \ud83d\ude02", "497": "I'm so clad I ordered a very big bulk the day before", "498": "Bromazolam pretty aiiit", "499": "Just switch over to real drugs and pharmaceuticals.

In order to come close to the amount of caffeine necessary to be harmful to the average person you would have to drink more than enough vodka to overdose on alcohol. With beer and amphetamine on the other hand the amphetamine will cancel the depressant effects of alcohol far more effectively than caffeine and is more likely to lead to excess alcohol consumption and/or excess amphetamine consumption as the beer will also take the edge off of the amphetamine. As someone who has had both alcohol and amphetamine and alcohol and caffeine I can tell you I consumed much, much more alcohol mixing with amphetamine.

It's just a smaller than normal dose. Microdosing implies consistently dosing very small amounts, 1-2mg daily. For 4-ACO-DMT, 20-25mg is the sweet spot of the perfect dose for most people.
