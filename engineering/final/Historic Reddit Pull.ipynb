       "  118: 'I want to start off by saying I had tried this combination last week and it didnt really go that well because of my complicated living situation, but that\\'s another story. Anyways this week I had moved into a new place and decided to just take some 3 ho pcp initially but during the experience i had the urge to try the combo out again and ended up having one of the craziest trips of my life. I dont usually write trip reports but i found nothing online about this combo and i think it definitely deserves more attention so id like to share my experience. Also id like to point out that the doses here are kind of high for this combo and you should start much lower if you decide to combine them. I have some tolerance and have a lot of experience with dissos and hallucinogens in general.\\n\\nSo I weighed up 23mg of 3 ho pcp, insufflated it and just layed down as I waited  for it to hit. I got the typical numbing, loss of balance and \"wooziness\" I get from 3 ho pcp within 10 minutes and started to get the heavy eyes and slight itch from the opioid receptor activity and decided to throw on some music. At first i just felt really neutral towards everything i put on and was just kind of spaced out but about an hour in I peaked and the euphoria and music appreciation really started to kick in. I smoked some weed and this just became stronger and my vision became blurrier.\\n\\nNow I was pretty dissociated, my vision had that fuzzy colorful static overlay and i was feeling really lovey and introspective. Now this is a typical 3 ho pcp experience which i dont really feel the need go go into too much detail about as there are lots of other reports online so ill just skip up to the point where i decided to dose mxipr.\\n\\nProbably about 2 or 3 hours into the experience i felt a sudden compulsion to dose some mxipr to give the combo another shot. I smoked another bowl and started off with 14mg snorted. Within 5 minutes I was already feeling the typical mxipr onset, a nos like rush and a feeling like me and everything i touched is draped in a warm silky blanket. This just became stronger and it was very enjoyable. The music appreciation somehow became even better and i just melted into the couch and felt incredibly at peace and euphoric. Knowing now how good this combo felt I wanted to go deeper and judging by how strong jusr 14 mg was i figured it wouldn\\'t take much more to hole, this is where things get really wild.\\n\\nI weighed up 24mg and snorted it, layed down and it felt like it was kicking in almost instantly so I threw on one of my favorite albums and closed my eyes. Very quickly i lost the sensation of my body and started morphing into different shapes colored in dark hues of red, yellow, and shades of black. Then suddenly i felt as if i was with my father who had passed away. I couldnt see him at first, it was mostly just a feeling of his presence and it was very comforting and euphoric. All i could feel was love and this strong sensation of euphoria akin to that of what nos is like on mdma. The sensations of morphing into different shapes became stronger and stronger and i started to feel like I was massive, then the size of an atom or both at the same time, which kept just enveloping me more and more.\\n\\nAll of these shapes were very round in shape, feeling very soft, silky, warm and fuzzy. It started to feel as if they were cogs and gears of an endless cosmic machine that was behind the scenes of normal sober reality causing everything that existed. I just kept changing into different parts of this \"cosmic machine\" and felt as if i was the entire thing but only capable of experiencing different parts at different times. At this point i had forgotten about my father or anything else in my life. I had a complete ego death and forgot about everything else. It was as if i had always been here and this was always my reality, just a cog in this giant cosmic machine. It felt really divine and holy almost, like my existence was just serving some kind of divine purpose on this giant machine for eternity. \\n\\nThis went on for a while and i started to realize i was just me, on a drug experiencing this and started to wonder if id ever come back. I came to the conclusion that i was here forever, and was completely ok with that. This very simple action of just being a cog in this divine cosmic machine felt very comforting and meaningful for some reason. Eventually i opened my eyes and my room was completely distorted. I recall looking at the door and it looked so massive yet so tiny at the same time and  it was completely mind boggling. \\n\\nAt this point i realized i was definitely coming back and was just tripping balls and started to feel an incredible euphoria and happiness. Everything in my life felt perfect and beautiful, i was so grateful for everything i had and was so excited to be alive. There was this strong feeling of love for everything, it was extremely similar to mdma but obviously quite different. The high continued to trail off and eventually the mxipr wore off and i just relaxed listening to music until i was able to sleep. The rest of the trip was pretty uneventful, just smoked a lot of weed and proceeded to lay on the couch listening to music and pondering my life and the universe until i drifted off to sleep. \\n\\nOverall the experience was absolutely incredible and probably the best trip of my life. I went to a place i only went to before when i k holed on 4 tabs of lsd and this was honestly somehow even more euphoric and incredible. It was very insightful and deep and more than i could have ever expected from a disso which is usually just braindead fun for me.

I hope it\\'s useful. \\n\\n\"Pharmacodynamics\\nLamotrigine likely prevents seizures and prevents mood symptoms via stabilizing presynaptic neuronal membranes and preventing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, which contribute to seizure activity.\\n\\nA note on cardiovascular effects\\n\\nThe metabolite of lamotrigine, 2-N-methyl metabolite (formed by glucuronidation), is reported to cause dose-dependent prolongations of the PR interval, widening of the QRS complex, and at higher doses, complete AV block. Although this harmful metabolite is only found in trace amounts in humans, plasma concentrations may increase in conditions that cause decreased drug glucuronidation, such as liver disease\\n\\nThe exact mechanism of action of lamotrigine is not fully elucidated, as it may exert cellular activities that contribute to its efficacy in a range of conditions. Although chemically unrelated, lamotrigine actions resemble those of phenytoin and carbamazepine, inhibiting voltage-sensitive sodium channels, stabilizing neuronal membranes, thereby modulating the release of presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitters.\\n\\nLamotrigine likely acts by inhibiting sodium currents by selective binding to the inactive sodium channel, suppressing the release of the excitatory amino acid, glutamate. The mechanism of action of lamotrigine in reducing anticonvulsant activity is likely the same in managing bipolar disorder. Studies on lamotrigine have identified its binding to sodium channels in a fashion similar to local anesthetics, which could explain the demonstrated clinical benefit of lamotrigine in some neuropathic pain states.\\n\\nLamotrigine displays binding properties to several different receptors. In laboratory binding assays, it demonstrates weak inhibitory effect on the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor. Lamotrigine also weakly binds to Adenosine A1/A2 receptors, α1/α2/β adrenergic receptors, dopamine D1/D2 receptors, GABA A/B receptors, histamine H1 receptors, κ-opioid receptor (KOR), mACh receptors and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors with an IC50>100 µM. Weak inhibitory effects were observed at sigma opioid receptors.14 An in vivo study revealed evidence that lamotrigine inhibits Cav2.3 (R-type) calcium currents, which may also contribute to its anticonvulsant effects.\"\\n\\nhttps://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00555',\n",

Moral concerns aside, I\\'d like to share this small report with y\\'all.\\n\\nI came home yesterday after a pretty tough day at work, and decided to treat myself with a medium (10mg) dose of intranasal 3-meo-pcp. I was looking for some nice and easy dissociation, and for those analgesic effects that usually ease the rigidity of my lower back and legs. No big deal, I told myself, just a bit of a mind-candy as a reward for doing what I\\'m supposed to do for the last week. I snort the stuff, lay back on my bed, and enjoy the come up while browsing Reddit.\\n\\nCouple hours in it, that tedious sense of \"why don\\'t we do a bit more\" starts to creep in. I know from experience that when that ensues, the best approach is to take a couple mg of Etizolam and wait for it to knock me out. Of course, that\\'s not what I did. Instead i proceeded to dump an \"\"\"\"accidental\"\"\"  dose of 20mg on my scale, and snort it all up with the efficiency and precision of a Dyson vacuum cleaner.\\n\\nAs soon as the substance hit my mucosae, all my well-meaning intents went straight out the window. I\\'m talking full on \"fuck it\" mindset, so obviously my next idea is the following: mix 150mg of 3-mmc in water, suck it up with a syringe, and promptly squirt the solution up my asshole. Sweet baby Jesus. Ten minutes later I\\'m absolutely paralyzed. I tried crystal meth and more emphathogens than I care to count, but this is euphoria as I\\'ve never felt before. I was in complete awe. The weird thing was that when I take stimulants in general, I usually do some type of activity that gets enhanced by the substance, whether it\\'s fapping, playing videogames or listening to music.\\n\\nThis time was different, anything I tried to do was just a disturbance to the absolute bliss my mind and body were feeling. It was like I had maxed out the \"feel good\" values of my being, so I just went back and forth between standing up in the middle of my room and laying on my bed for two hours, doing nothing but contemplating what miraculous chemical interaction was going on inside me. I ended up taking three mg of Etizolam after three hours, because I was terrified that the comedown would be hitting too hard (the higher you go, the harder you smash when you inevitably fall down). I had my fair share of manic episodes with 3-meo-pcp mixed with stimulants, but this time was really something else.

At the time of writing this report, I’ve had one 10mg, two 20mg, and two 30mg trips.  The 10mg trip was done alone and the rest were done with a very close friend of mine who was tripping on equal doses with me each time.  These are also mostly my own personal experiences so don’t expect every aspect to be the same for every person.\\n\\n# Visuals\\n\\n**10mg** \\\\- Not much here.  My vision felt slightly different, as if subtle, barely perceptible changes were happening but I couldn’t identify what they were.  This might have just been a mood change, however I did notice a slight curve on the bottom of a square painting in my room, probably due to my curved bed frame that it’s hung above, this was the only visual effect that I was able to notice.\\n\\n**20mg** \\\\- There are a lot of subtle visuals for me here, but nothing particularly interesting.  Small pattern enhancement, mostly where patterns already existed.  Shifting my perspective on objects gives the illusion of them rotating.  Fairly strong fish-eye effect.  Possibly other slight, barely noticeable spatial distortions.  There may have been very slight color saturation.\\n\\n**30mg** \\\\- This is where the real visuals started.  Decent spatial distortions occurred such as the room changing shape, angles curving and moving, and the fish-eye effect.  Drifting occurred, mostly noticeably close up and on small scales.  The shape of my face would change while looking in the mirror, not in any unsettling or unrealistic ways, I found it fun to watch.  Both color and pattern enhancement existed but weren’t particularly strong.  I never experienced tracers or afterimages, but my partner did get some afterimages.  There was a subtle strobe effect at the edges of my vision, mostly only in well lit areas, but wasn’t unpleasant by any means.  Visual geometry occurred, mostly on surfaces that were already textured, and for the most part took on the colors of the surface they were on.\\n\\nVisual geometry usually wouldn’t appear until I stared at a surface for a few seconds.  Fractals would start growing, sometimes continuing to morph and melt into different shapes, and sometimes getting frozen in place until I blinked or moved my eyes.  They occasionally very closely resembled the sectioned-off slices of fractals moving in a big circle I experienced on 25e-nboh.  In fact, the only difference during those parts was that 2c-b’s shapes were much less clear and rigid, and would wave and melt into different geometry after a few seconds.  I’m not sure how much I would’ve experienced this if I hadn’t of done nboh before.\\n\\nMost of the spatial distortions weren’t super pronounced compared to something like shrooms or metocin, I had an easy time recognizing objects and never saw anything transform or dramatically change shape.  The geometry was the only really strong component of the visuals.\\n\\n# Headspace\\n\\n**10mg** \\\\- Very noticeable mood enhancement.  I felt stronger connections to people around me and talking to people felt really good, even saying hello to strangers while on a walk was really satisfying.  I’m normally very introverted and don’t have much push to interact with people, but even on 10mg I felt an abnormally strong pull to talk to people, even ones I didn’t know.  I also wasn’t very afraid of talking nor did I overthink what I wanted to say as much as I normally do.\\n\\nI refrained from talking too much to people who didn’t know I was tripping, because despite being fairly clear-headed, I was having a difficult time determining what my “normal-acting” self was like.\\n\\nI don’t think I had any noticeable stimulation.  I experienced a little time dilation, but any other effects of psychedelic headspace were faint.\\n\\n**20mg** \\\\- I’m not sure if I’d ever prefer this dosage.  It was too strong to be a functional mood enhancer but the psychedelic effects were still too weak to be interesting.  I felt more of that euphoric warmth when interacting with others and it was more constant, however, it was less fun because I kept finding it difficult to think.  My head was fuzzy and thoughts were muddied, making it difficult to analyze myself or use complex critical thinking, it felt stifling.\\n\\nThere was still only a small amount of psychedelic headspace and it seemed to only strongly express itself when I was anxious.  Most of the time I felt more confident in my ability to talk to people but I also wouldn’t trust myself to easily act sober.  Time dilation surprisingly wasn’t much stronger than at 10mg.\\n\\n**30mg** \\\\- This was finally a fully psychedelic headspace for me.  Because of the way it muddied my thoughts together, it felt unique from other psychedelics I’ve had.  I never felt like I was being overloaded with too much random information, it all just flowed and melted into itself, sometimes becoming consciously indistinguishable, but like I still intuitively knew what it all meant.  This made it easier to prevent myself from getting anxious, but at the same time made anxiety more difficult for me to get rid of once it was there.  Overall it was actually pretty pleasant, unlike at 20mg.\\n\\nAll of my thoughts felt warm, fuzzy, and euphoric.  Feelings of love and connection to others were profound and nearly constant.  Any interaction with my partner felt wonderful and intensely meaningful.  The joy of being with another person was even stronger at this dose, but interestingly, I also felt more okay with being alone.  The love and connection I felt for others was constant enough that I still felt connected even when not in their immediate presence.\\n\\nI still didn’t get a lot of time dilation at this dose compared to other psychedelics.  It was a little stronger than 10mg, but not significantly so.\\n\\nRecalling memories was only mildly difficult and I never experienced that magical “new and alien” feel everything has to it on something like shrooms or LSD.  Objects were all still very easily recognizable.  I feel like this effect would start to manifest more at higher doses though.\\n\\nMood enhancement was weak if there at all.\\n\\nStimulation was mild and not very noticeable for me, however my partner experienced much stronger stimulation.\\n\\n**Notes** \\\\- 2c-b’s headspace is a combination of psychedelic, entactogenic, and stimulating.  Decent psychedelic headspace for me didn’t show much until 30mg, and it only had mild, sometimes not even noticeable stimulation.  The entactogen part is the strongest aspect for me and showed itself at every dosage I took.  However, my partner always got much stronger stimulation than I did.\\n\\nIt’s headspace for the most part is very warm and cozy to me.  It’s not easily overwhelming like a lot of other psychedelics, but don’t make the assumption that bad trips can’t happen.  One 20mg trip I had turned really bad due to insecurities I had about other people during the trip, and I ended up having to take a bit of xanax to prevent myself from freaking out.  You may assume that it’s entactogenic effects work the exact same way as MDMA, but they don’t seem to.  On 2c-b, you crave connection to others and interaction feels more meaningful, but for both me and my partner, we noticed that feelings of loneliness or social rejection can be much more intense than when sober.  Be smart and careful with your dosages and setting, just like any other psychedelic.\\n\\nI think it’d be hard for me to trip alone on mid-range dosages.  At 10mg and lower it’s just a good mood enhancer.  At 20mg I really needed to be around people to feel good.  But at 30mg, the euphoria was pretty constant and came with almost every thought I had.  I don’t think I would *need* to be with someone in order to feel it at that point, but it would be preferred.  I imagine at higher doses it’s persistent enough to still feel okay while tripping alone, don’t take my word for it though, experiment for yourself.\\n\\nA really important aspect of the headspace for me is that while it enhances emotions, it always muddies them for me as well.  I’m normally very good at analyzing my emotions, and psychedelics usually enhance my ability to do this.  I imagine lines being drawn to each thought, I can trace their paths, make them stop, or make them branch in other directions.  2c-b consistently prevents me from doing this.  It feels as if my thoughts and feelings no longer have borders and clear connections between them, they’re all muddied together in one big soup.  I can still explore them, there’s just no longer a good map for it, nor do I have much control over where I go.  It also interferes with my critical thinking ability for the same reason.  This often makes it much more difficult for me to problem solve my way through anxiety on 2c-b.  It became less of a problem at 30mg, because I felt like I still intuitively knew what most of my thoughts and feelings meant even though I couldn’t entirely keep track of them, I wouldn’t want to rely on that though.\\n\\nAfter becoming aware of this effect and getting more used to the headspace of 2c-b, I’ve been able to function in this regard a little better, but it’s still difficult.  The inhibition lasts even after the trip ends and gradually goes away over the next few days, sometimes nearly a week.  I haven’t heard anyone else describing this effect online, however my trip partner agreed that they also experienced this.\\n\\n# Nausea / Bodyload\\n\\n**10mg** \\\\- Even this small dose was pretty rough.  I took it on an empty stomach with no ginger and within 15 minutes my stomach began feeling like it was full of rocks.  I had to lay down for the first 90 minutes and wait for it to settle.  It passed though and I had no discomfort afterward.\\n\\nAfter the trip I had faint muscle tightness but it was gone the next day.\\n\\n**20mg** \\\\- At these doses and higher, I took a ginger capsule 10-30 minutes before dosing each time.  With the ginger, I had no nausea and only mild stomach cramps for the first 60 minutes after dosing.  The cramps would gradually fade and be completely gone by 2 hours.  Very easily tolerable.\\n\\nI had slight muscle tightness during and after the comedown from stimulation, but it was always gone after sleeping.\\n\\n**30mg** \\\\- First time I did this dose, it was on an empty stomach and with two ginger capsules.  I had the same mild stomach problems as I did with 20mg.\\n\\nSecond time I took this dose, I had eaten half of a chicken sandwich 15 minutes before dosing, which was a mistake.  Despite taking ginger with it, I was couch bound for the entire first half of the trip, getting increasingly more nauseous.  It only went away when I decided I needed to throw up two and half hours after dosing.  Although the nausea went away and I made sure to re-hydrate myself, I still got pretty bad cramps occasionally for the rest of the trip.  Thankfully they weren’t bad enough to ruin the experience and I still had a great time.\\n\\nMuscle tightness wasn’t any different from 20mg.\\n\\n**Notes** \\\\- After my first 10mg dose, I made sure to take it with one or two 350mg powdered ginger capsules I made, which helped significantly.  However, my partner, who has a really sensitive stomach, has yet to get much if any stomach discomfort from 2c-b, even without ginger.\\n\\n# Length\\n\\n**10mg**\\n\\nFirst effects: 20 minutes.\\n\\nPeak: 2-2.5 hours.\\n\\nSober: 4.5 hours\\n\\n**20mg**\\n\\nFirst effects: 10 minutes?  Maybe placebo, definite effects at 20 minutes.\\n\\nPeak: 2 - 2.5 hours\\n\\nSober: 5 hours\\n\\n**30mg**\\n\\nFirst effects: 10 minutes, also maybe placebo.  Definite effects at 20 minutes.\\n\\nPeak: 2 - 3 hours\\n\\nSober: 6 hours\\n\\n# Afterglow\\n\\nThe afterglow actually didn’t change much in strength for me regardless of dose.  Despite 2c-b’s short duration, the afterglow for both me and my partner lasted several days, sometimes up to a week.  I felt a lot of empathogenic feelings and residual warmth pretty strongly for the first two days after the trip, and they would fade over the course of the following few days.  The trouble I have with my thoughts being fuzzy and difficult to navigate are equally present during the afterglow though, which isn’t very welcome.\\n\\nUnlike me, my partner experienced MDMA-like depression after each trip (although shorter and more mild), as well as the lasting difficulty with thinking.\\n\\n# Other Effects / Enhancements\\n\\n**Music Appreciation:**  I couldn’t feel the music inside my head as much as other psychedelics.  It occasionally created imagery in my head at 30mg but not very much.  However, at every dose the emotions of a song had a greater intensity and warmth to them, and contributed more strongly to the overall mood.\\n\\n**Tactile Enhancement:**  I didn’t get any particular tactile enhancement for things like soft blankets or other inanimate objects, but I did have it mildly with my partner at 20mg, and very strongly at 30mg.  Snuggling was easily one of the best parts at 30mg.\\n\\n**Motor Skills:**  At 20mg, motor skills were perfectly normal.  At 30mg, they were only mildly affected.  Considering how high I otherwise was at 30mg, it doesn’t seem to inhibit my coordination much compared to other substances.\\n\\n**Enjoying Food:**  I never felt the need to eat but I really enjoyed it when I did, a bit better than sober.\\n\\n**Dancing:**  I’m normally kind of awkward and have never been one for dancing, but 2c-b made it much easier and even enjoyable, especially at 20-30mg.\\n\\n**Tolerance:**  I haven’t re-dosed on 2c-b but according to friends, they won’t feel a reduction in effects until a third consecutive dose.  On one occasion my partner also tripped on LSD the day after doing 30mg of 2c-b and felt no reduction in effects.\\n\\n# Compared to MDMA\\n\\nWere the entactogenic qualities at any dose comparable to MDMA?  Not really.  Not because they weren’t as strong, but because they just felt so different.  For reference, I have only done doses of 100mg of MDMA, and I’ll be making comparisons based off of 30mg of 2c-b.\\n\\n**Social Interactions / Euphoria:**  MDMA gave me a soft, warm, gentle love for everyone and everything around me.  It almost completely got rid of any social anxiety.  It stopped me from overthinking my interactions but at the same time made me so emotionally aware of everything going on.  It turned what would normally be an incredibly anxious situation into something that felt easy, natural, and even enjoyable.  The euphoria was clear, honest, simple, and pure.\\n\\nWhile 2c-b encouraged human interaction and generally made it easier and more enjoyable, I was still somewhat prone to overthinking things and when it anxiety hit, it hit *hard.*  The euphoric warmth and love on 2c-b is so much more intense in a way that’s difficult to describe.  It doesn’t have the honest purity of MDMA, nor does it have the deep emotional clarity.  It’s more complex, but at the same time more muddied and confusing.  It’s so intense and up in your face but the lack of coherence makes it... in a way, more difficult to take comfort in.  This isn’t to say that it’s not enjoyable, because I still very much enjoyed it, it’s just such a different experience.\\n\\n**Tactile Enhancement:**  Tactile enhancement is also different between the two.  For 2c-b, it was much more physically intense but I only felt it with my partner.  For MDMA, it was a more broad enhancement that applied to lots of different things.  It was strongest with my partner, less physically intense, but softer and more emotional.  For me personally, I’d prefer the tactile enhancement of MDMA, but they’re different.\\n\\n**Therapeutic Purposes:**  I think MDMA is generally easier to use as a tool for therapy.  On MDMA my emotions were so much more easily understood, flawlessly communicated, and I had no fear talking about them, even when it was about something difficult.  2c-b still causes me anxiety in difficult situations and understanding my emotions is even more difficult than when sober.  However, that’s not to say it doesn’t have therapeutic value.  Two of my friends have both used 2c-b to process trauma that they couldn’t before and also to better understand their relationships with others.\\n\\n# Summary\\n\\nI’m not someone who’s typically very interested in entactogens and stimulants, so I wanted to do 2c-b for it’s psychedelic effects.  Because of this, I really didn’t think I liked it much at first.  The muddy, difficult to analyze headspace and the excessively long afterglow made it not worth it at 10 and 20mg.  Once I got to 30mg though, I absolutely loved it.  It gave me a unique experience that I haven’t quite had on another psychedelic before and it was a ton of fun.  The afterglow is still something I hate dealing with, so I don’t think it’s something I’ll do often compared to other things, but I am really excited to do more 30mg trips and higher.\\n\\nNote:  Since writing this report, I have done a much stronger insufflated dose, and my predictions on higher doses were confirmed.  I felt like it'd be much better to write second, much shorter report for that experience though rather than trying to cram it into an already super long post that I had already organized, so that's what I'll do.\",\n",

       "  500: 'I want to preface this with 2 things \\n\\n1: I\\'m tripping rn, apologies \\n\\n2: it\\'s funny to me that I usually think to myself \"why is this person on Reddit rn\" when I read posts like this. But here we are \\n\\nAnyway, today didn\\'t go exactly according to plan but it is nice. \\n\\nSo my partner and I both work from home and as a result have been spending a lot of time together at the expense of alone time. Today she had an appointment in the afternoon and was planning to spend some time after that shopping and just generally being out and about. And I was gonna hang out at home/anywhere else.\\n\\nAfter she had left and I finished up some work stuff, I thought \"ok tite what should I do now? It looks like it\\'s gonna rain so I don\\'t want to go out there\"\\n\\nAfter not very much thought I considered doing some Ketamine and listening to music . Maybe Hole, maybe not, either way just vibe for an hour or so. \\n\\nAs i was getting out the K, I started eyeing the 2c-b. I had read reports that hbr (which I have) doesn\\'t hurt as badly as HCl (which i have had previously) . So I thought \"fuck it\" and got out about 10mg of that. \\n\\nSo I made some lines totaling approx 80 mg ket, added the 2c-b to one of those, and thought here we go! \\n\\nIt was expectedly very nice. Also did not hurt ! Very badly ! \\n\\nI laid down with some headphones and music and was lost in the CEVs and generally being on another plane of existence. \\n\\nAfter I guess like 30 mins I was getting some messages so I looked at my phone. A few were from work so i ignored the shit out of those. But some were from my partner. Apparently it did in fact rain. And directly on top of her before the appointment, no less. (i was listening to music with my eyes closed so i didn\\'t notice the passing storm)\\n\\n So instead of her having a nice afternoon, she is soaking wet and in a (rightfully) bad mood.  she doesn\\'t want to go shopping anymore and says she wants  to come back home rather than slog around in wet shoes and jeans. Fair. Of course I understand and really just want her to have the best day she can. In the end she decides to stop by the supermarket then head home.\\n\\nI\\'m bummed that she isn\\'t having a good time. But was able to let her vent a bit and think hopefully she\\'ll be able to turn her day around. \\n\\nMEANWHILE I\\'m turnt as shit ! I could barely see my phone during that whole text exchange and was hoping that i made as much sense as I assumed I did. \\n\\nA big pro of Ketamine/dissociatives is the ability it gives one to just \\'carry on\\' and not attach your personal emotions to things. Which is usually not the case with psychedelics in my experience. So after confirming she\\'s ok, i  laid back down and got back into the music immediately. \\n\\nAfter a little bit I started to realize I had to kind of make moves since she would be home soon. My partner and I both use substances, together and separately, but i hadn\\'t told her about today because it was a last minute decision. And she had a really shitty afternoon so I didn\\'t want to bring her wrath upon me by telling her i was actually having a grand ol\\' time. I thought it best to just keep this one discreet and give her some much needed alone time when she got home. So i planned to grab an umbrella, head to the park and hope for the best. \\n\\nThis is about 2 ish hours from the very start. So the ket is mostly gone but I\\'m very much on 2c-b.\\n\\nAs i was pumping myself up to leave, she called me from downstairs asking me to let her in because she can\\'t find her key. Dang ok of course no problem. I step into the hall, triple check that i locked the apartment, and press the elevator button. I was NOT expecting a person to be there when it opened . So i kind of scared myself and then apologized to the guy. And got in anyway...\\n\\nGet to the bottom of the elevator and when it opens there is my partner. She had found her key after all. I realized I forgot an umbrella so i went back up with her. \\n\\nAt this point it really looks like it\\'s going to rain again, so i decided against going to the park. But i still wanted to get out of the apartment for a little. What small task could i do ? Of course going to the bank is the best idea. \\n\\nSo i grab my debit card, umbrella and keys and head out. It was the first time I was outside today so that was nice. It was DEF gonna rain so there was a sense of urgency to the mission. But in a fun way. \\n\\nSo i get to the bank. And this is the first time I have been to this particular bank since mine is not around here but i needed to get some cash. I saw an empty ATM so i went up to it and put my card in. At that point did i decide to look at the giant words on the screen \"NOT IN SERVICE\". lol so I\\'m like \"oh\" and then back up and wait for one of the other 4 people at the working ATMs to finish. I successfully completed the task, put the cash and card safely in my zipper pocket and head out. The security guard who witnessed the whole ordeal was probably like wtf is wrong with this guy.\\n\\nI made it back to the building JUST in time before a crazy thunderstorm. I dropped the money off, made sure my partner didn\\'t need anything, and came down to a common area to chill. While sitting here listening to music i decided to write this post. \\n\\nThanks for reading if you made it this far! I hope you have an awesome day :) I\\'m also not going to read this so i hope it makes sense :)\\n\\n\\nTLDR:.  spontaneously combo\\'d 2c-b and Ketamine when I thought i would have the place to myself for a few hours. I did not, in fact, have the place to myself for a few hours but had a great time anyway ! Recommend this combo .also snorting 2c-b hbr doesn\\'t hurt as badly as hcl apparently',\n",

(The longest I regularly took them was 3 months, after that I took a break for a year and now I just use occasionally, the longest will be like using it for 2 weeks cause I dont wanna deal with bad withdrawal, and obviously there are cons to benzos, they can make me feel out of it and groggy/sometimes do dumb things and make bad decisions.\\n\\nBut man... Like dude, man this stuff has made me feel a lot better lately, I''ve been dealing with a breakup, covid has hit hard (gotta lose some weight and stop ordering in since being jobless) and I haven;t been able to see my friends as much. But tonight, I went to a friend's birthday party. And that may not sound like a big deal. But I have pretty bad OCD/social/general anxiety and have had bouts of depression. I'm lucky to have a small friend group that I see sometimes (though not as much these days) and sorry back to the point, (I just took my dose, can you tell? Haha. I'm playing some My Bloody Valentine btw in some really nice headphones and man it hits different. I also used a dab pen, took some dabs and had some subway cookies (highly recommend you heat those bad bosy up in the microwave for perfection)\\n\\nUsually I turn down going to big family social events. But I've been trying to say more lately. And I had a blast! I was actually coming down from a dose but I felt super chill, relaxed, chillin like a villain and just comfy. I talked to everyone, every single person there I sat down and listened to their life story, and each person had their own unique qualities I appreciated. (The girl in the wheelchair was the best man, funny as hell and she deserved more laughs at her jokes) But no really, it really helped with some intense anxiety/depression and just to feel that super social/talkative, people said I was being funny and someone called me the life of the party as an introvert who typically keeps to myself and doesn't go out a ton - (And of course I have my issues, we all do, did some therapy recently and just finished it and it helped a ton) it feels nice to feel like that when typically I'm more introverted and in my shell, I can see how this drug can be addictive (Hence why I stopped etiz after using it on and off for a few months) I guess occasional ussage is the best option right? But damn it, it's like the final boss to defeat anxiety. Also apologies if this is WAY too detailed haha. Originally this was gonna be short. I high. n\",\n",

For reference I have used heavily amphetamine in the past on this same mix of prescriptions (buproprion + ssri) and had no issues. \\n\\nIt's my understanding that SSRIs generally do not mix well with drugs that act on serotonin (MDMA is the most common example). My interest in the drug however is strictly as an amphetamine alternative so if I were able to harness the dopamine/norepinephrine effects safely it wouldn't be of much concern to me that serotonin activity is muted.\\n\\nThe question then is one of safety. I presume that being on Buproprion (a cathinone itself) carries little risk if high doses / habituation are avoided. I also presume that being on SSRIs carries only the risk of muting so much effect that I would be drawn towards taking higher doses of methcathinone. \\n\\nI however still have much to learn in neuropharmacology and wanted to see what I think the most educated drug community on reddit thinks of using low-medium dose methcathinone while on 30mg fluoxetine and 300mg buproprion XL.

What you want is to examine, understand, and integrate those feelings so that you can deal with them in a healthy way. It's not confronting, it's communing. It may be difficult and painful, but it's better to let yourself feel them fully rather than avoiding or fighting. If you have a close friend that you trust, it could be helpful to have them with you or available nearby in case you need to talk or express how you're feeling to someone (online resources like Tripsit are also an option). I think what you'll learn is a renewed appreciation for the role your mother has played in your life and how important it is to be truly *present* when you're with her during this time.\\n\\nNot to hijack, but a brief story since it feels relevant:  \\n\\n[redacted]\\n\\nI'm sorry about your mom, I understand from personal experience how difficult this time can be. If you think you need this trip to process your feelings then go for it, I hope it helps you. Afterward though I'd suggest putting any drug use aside for awhile to focus on being there for your mother and your family, with an emphasis on really being *present* and not letting the sadness and concern over the future rob you of that time and those experiences with them.\",\n",

Hell, id say shrooms is better for this. I'd wait until a funeral to drop acid, or after. But while shit is hitting the fan? You want introspection, not mania. I would still say sober is 100% the best answer here, but if youre going to turn to drugs...no coke, meth, benzos, heroin, or any drugs other than some pot, shrooms acid or traditional psychedelics(not too experienced with analogs/rc's. 4 ho met could be good for this but it's more of party shrooms than not).

I know it's not great, but I would really push yourself sober to find a light through that tunnel. I havent lost a mom, but have been around death most of my life, and have lost many of those to cancer. It's not something that you should use drugs to cope with. In my opinion, you miss out on a lot of the romance to death, which is where all the beauty is. The personal journey through all of that pain and change is what will bring you the strength to help make this transition as plesant as possible, and to carry the lessons of their life properly. Drugs rob you of that strength to carry it. They provide what you feel you cant have, without the tools to achieve that. But with that being said, i have always turned to drugs and alcohol in moments of death (except for the deaths as a child) and people are completely capable of going through those lessons fucked up. It will just take longer, and hurt more. So do what you are capable of, and take care of yourself when you need to. Take it slow, a little can go a long way here. That's the goal at least. I would stick to weed, lsd and its analogs(the safe ones) and shrooms. Maybe dmt? Psychedelics in general, I would opt for the more traditional ones and their analogs. Morning glory seeds (lsa) might be perfect for this. Def no benzos, don't drink, id avoid discos, no opiates forsure, no cocaine, no meth or any stims for that matter.

That is just a thought. A thought says \"I deal with negative thoughts\"; that is a thought, but without the necessary discernment it seems like we are this one that deals with negative thoughts. This leads to further complications. One misidentification creates the next one.\\n\\nThere is no need to break up any thought, that is a total misconception. The thoughts are acknowledged by themselves; there is an awareness of them. It is our duty to be aware of the awareness, and not of the thoughts. Thoughts have no relevancy for pure awareness. They are only part of the manifest dream; they are not to be identified with; you truly have nothing to do with them; they come and go by themselves. You are only to be aware of the awareness of them, not of them.\\n\\nWhen you \\'focus on stillness\\' you are not doing it correctly anyway. Why? Because you are taking yourself to be the one focusing on stillness, rather than being aware that you are the stillness itself. Not doing this correctly will result in no results.\\n\\nYou are not dealing with any depression nor anxiety, that is just another thought. A thought appears and says \"I am dealing with depression and anxiety\" and you think it is yourself, while it is not yourself. The \"I\" that you are is free of any depression or anxiety, it is total and absolute freedom, infinite awareness; God. That \"I\" which you actually are is not suffering, so it is our highest priority to realize that divine \"I\" that we already are and just be aware of that \"I\" eternally; which is utterly natural.\\n\\nYou say \"I wish I wasn\\'t this way\" but that is just another thought, you aren\\'t this way in the first place! You are only imagining that you are this way, and then you identify with the imagination of yourself instead of being the reality of yourself which is free of any limitations or \\'ways\\' or \\'I\\'s\\'\\n\\nThere are no positive nor negative thoughts; all thoughts are merely thoughts. To say a thought is positive is merely another thought. A thought appears; then another thought interprets it and calls it \\'positive\\' or \\'negative\\' based on its biases and conditioning.\\n\\nThoughts are just thoughts. The only time when thoughts are positive or negative is when we identify with them being positive or negative, which means we are being unaware of our true nature and are perpetuating falsehood.\\n\\nAnother thing to understand is that you are not the doer of actions. If you understand you are this cosmic consciousness and not a separate doer of an exclusive body-mind and you understand all bodies and minds are animated by this cosmic consciousness-existence which is what is always present then there is no more relevancy to thoughts like \"I shouldn\\'t have done that\"; what does that even mean? You haven\\'t done anything. You are not the doer of actions. When you know you are not the doer of actions it will not matter what thoughts appear and what they say. They are known to be only thoughts; what is the harm? Be aware of the awareness of the thoughts, everything is troublesome when we are not being aware of the awareness, and nothing is troublesome when we are being aware of the awareness, the universal consciousness that we are.',\n",
