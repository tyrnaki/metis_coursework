       "  '118': 'i want to start off by saying i had tried this combination last week and it didnt really go that well because of my complicated living situation  but that s another story  anyways this week i had moved into a new place and decided to just take some   ho pcp initially but during the experience i had the urge to try the combo out again and ended up having one of the craziest trips of my life  i dont usually write trip reports but i found nothing online about this combo and i think it definitely deserves more attention so id like to share my experience  also id like to point out that the doses here are kind of high for this combo and you should start much lower if you decide to combine them  i have some tolerance and have a lot of experience with dissos and hallucinogens in general \\n\\nso i weighed up   of   ho pcp  insufflated it and just layed down as i waited  for it to hit  i got the typical numbing  loss of balance and  wooziness  i get from   ho pcp within   minutes and started to get the heavy eyes and slight itch from the opioid receptor activity and decided to throw on some music  at first i just felt really neutral towards everything i put on and was just kind of spaced out but about an hour in i peaked and the euphoria and music appreciation really started to kick in  i smoked some weed and this just became stronger and my vision became blurrier \\n\\nnow i was pretty dissociated  my vision had that fuzzy colorful static overlay and i was feeling really lovey and introspective  now this is a typical   ho pcp experience which i dont really feel the need go go into too much detail about as there are lots of other reports online so ill just skip up to the point where i decided to dose mxipr \\n\\nprobably about   or   hours into the experience i felt a sudden compulsion to dose some mxipr to give the combo another shot  i smoked another bowl and started off with   snorted  within   minutes i was already feeling the typical mxipr onset  a nos like rush and a feeling like me and everything i touched is draped in a warm silky blanket  this just became stronger and it was very enjoyable  the music appreciation somehow became even better and i just melted into the couch and felt incredibly at peace and euphoric  knowing now how good this combo felt i wanted to go deeper and judging by how strong jusr   mg was i figured it wouldn t take much more to hole  this is where things get really wild \\n\\ni weighed up   and snorted it  layed down and it felt like it was kicking in almost instantly so i threw on one of my favorite albums and closed my eyes  very quickly i lost the sensation of my body and started morphing into different shapes colored in dark hues of red  yellow  and shades of black  then suddenly i felt as if i was with my father who had passed away  i couldnt see him at first  it was mostly just a feeling of his presence and it was very comforting and euphoric  all i could feel was love and this strong sensation of euphoria akin to that of what nos is like on mdma  the sensations of morphing into different shapes became stronger and stronger and i started to feel like i was massive  then the size of an atom or both at the same time  which kept just enveloping me more and more \\n\\nall of these shapes were very round in shape  feeling very soft  silky  warm and fuzzy  it started to feel as if they were cogs and gears of an endless cosmic machine that was behind the scenes of normal sober reality causing everything that existed  i just kept changing into different parts of this  cosmic machine  and felt as if i was the entire thing but only capable of experiencing different parts at different times  at this point i had forgotten about my father or anything else in my life  i had a complete ego death and forgot about everything else  it was as if i had always been here and this was always my reality  just a cog in this giant cosmic machine  it felt really divine and holy almost  like my existence was just serving some kind of divine purpose on this giant machine for eternity  \\n\\nthis went on for a while and i started to realize i was just me  on a drug experiencing this and started to wonder if id ever come back  i came to the conclusion that i was here forever  and was completely ok with that  this very simple action of just being a cog in this divine cosmic machine felt very comforting and meaningful for some reason  eventually i opened my eyes and my room was completely distorted  i recall looking at the door and it looked so massive yet so tiny at the same time and  it was completely mind boggling  \\n\\nat this point i realized i was definitely coming back and was just tripping balls and started to feel an incredible euphoria and happiness  everything in my life felt perfect and beautiful  i was so grateful for everything i had and was so excited to be alive  there was this strong feeling of love for everything  it was extremely similar to mdma but obviously quite different  the high continued to trail off and eventually the mxipr wore off and i just relaxed listening to music until i was able to sleep  the rest of the trip was pretty uneventful  just smoked a lot of weed and proceeded to lay on the couch listening to music and pondering my life and the universe until i drifted off to sleep  \\n\\noverall the experience was absolutely incredible and probably the best trip of my life  i went to a place i only went to before when i k holed on   tabs of lsd and this was honestly somehow even more euphoric and incredible  it was very insightful and deep and more than i could have ever expected from a disso which is usually just braindead fun for me  i highly recommend this combo to any of you psychonauts

       "  '497': ' \\n\\n  intro\\n\\nthese are my descriptions of the visuals  headspace  and other effects of   b that i’ve had at dosages between       all of these trips were orally dosed  some as pre pressed pills and some as capsuled hbr powder   the pills may have been slightly under dosed but they didn’t seem to be significantly so   at the time of writing this report  i’ve had one    two    and two   trips   the   trip was done alone and the rest were done with a very close friend of mine who was tripping on equal doses with me each time   these are also mostly my own personal experiences so don’t expect every aspect to be the same for every person \\n\\n  visuals\\n\\n         not much here   my vision felt slightly different  as if subtle  barely perceptible changes were happening but i couldn’t identify what they were   this might have just been a mood change  however i did notice a slight curve on the bottom of a square painting in my room  probably due to my curved bed frame that it’s hung above  this was the only visual effect that i was able to notice \\n\\n         there are a lot of subtle visuals for me here  but nothing particularly interesting   small pattern enhancement  mostly where patterns already existed   shifting my perspective on objects gives the illusion of them rotating   fairly strong fish eye effect   possibly other slight  barely noticeable spatial distortions   there may have been very slight color saturation \\n\\n         this is where the real visuals started   decent spatial distortions occurred such as the room changing shape  angles curving and moving  and the fish eye effect   drifting occurred  mostly noticeably close up and on small scales   the shape of my face would change while looking in the mirror  not in any unsettling or unrealistic ways  i found it fun to watch   both color and pattern enhancement existed but weren’t particularly strong   i never experienced tracers or afterimages  but my partner did get some afterimages   there was a subtle strobe effect at the edges of my vision  mostly only in well lit areas  but wasn’t unpleasant by any means   visual geometry occurred  mostly on surfaces that were already textured  and for the most part took on the colors of the surface they were on \\n\\nvisual geometry usually wouldn’t appear until i stared at a surface for a few seconds   fractals would start growing  sometimes continuing to morph and melt into different shapes  and sometimes getting frozen in place until i blinked or moved my eyes   they occasionally very closely resembled the sectioned off slices of fractals moving in a big circle i experienced on   nboh   in fact  the only difference during those parts was that   b’s shapes were much less clear and rigid  and would wave and melt into different geometry after a few seconds   i’m not sure how much i would’ve experienced this if i hadn’t of done nboh before \\n\\nmost of the spatial distortions weren’t super pronounced compared to something like shrooms or metocin  i had an easy time recognizing objects and never saw anything transform or dramatically change shape   the geometry was the only really strong component of the visuals \\n\\n  headspace\\n\\n         very noticeable mood enhancement   i felt stronger connections to people around me and talking to people felt really good  even saying hello to strangers while on a walk was really satisfying   i’m normally very introverted and don’t have much push to interact with people  but even on   i felt an abnormally strong pull to talk to people  even ones i didn’t know   i also wasn’t very afraid of talking nor did i overthink what i wanted to say as much as i normally do \\n\\ni refrained from talking too much to people who didn’t know i was tripping  because despite being fairly clear headed  i was having a difficult time determining what my “normal acting” self was like \\n\\ni don’t think i had any noticeable stimulation   i experienced a little time dilation  but any other effects of psychedelic headspace were faint \\n\\n         i’m not sure if i’d ever prefer this dosage   it was too strong to be a functional mood enhancer but the psychedelic effects were still too weak to be interesting   i felt more of that euphoric warmth when interacting with others and it was more constant  however  it was less fun because i kept finding it difficult to think   my head was fuzzy and thoughts were muddied  making it difficult to analyze myself or use complex critical thinking  it felt stifling \\n\\nthere was still only a small amount of psychedelic headspace and it seemed to only strongly express itself when i was anxious   most of the time i felt more confident in my ability to talk to people but i also wouldn’t trust myself to easily act sober   time dilation surprisingly wasn’t much stronger than at   \\n\\n         this was finally a fully psychedelic headspace for me   because of the way it muddied my thoughts together  it felt unique from other psychedelics i’ve had   i never felt like i was being overloaded with too much random information  it all just flowed and melted into itself  sometimes becoming consciously indistinguishable  but like i still intuitively knew what it all meant   this made it easier to prevent myself from getting anxious  but at the same time made anxiety more difficult for me to get rid of once it was there   overall it was actually pretty pleasant  unlike at   \\n\\nall of my thoughts felt warm  fuzzy  and euphoric   feelings of love and connection to others were profound and nearly constant   any interaction with my partner felt wonderful and intensely meaningful   the joy of being with another person was even stronger at this dose  but interestingly  i also felt more okay with being alone   the love and connection i felt for others was constant enough that i still felt connected even when not in their immediate presence \\n\\ni still didn’t get a lot of time dilation at this dose compared to other psychedelics   it was a little stronger than    but not significantly so \\n\\nrecalling memories was only mildly difficult and i never experienced that magical “new and alien” feel everything has to it on something like shrooms or lsd   objects were all still very easily recognizable   i feel like this effect would start to manifest more at higher doses though \\n\\nmood enhancement was weak if there at all \\n\\nstimulation was mild and not very noticeable for me  however my partner experienced much stronger stimulation \\n\\n  notes        b’s headspace is a combination of psychedelic  entactogenic  and stimulating   decent psychedelic headspace for me didn’t show much until    and it only had mild  sometimes not even noticeable stimulation   the entactogen part is the strongest aspect for me and showed itself at every dosage i took   however  my partner always got much stronger stimulation than i did \\n\\nit’s headspace for the most part is very warm and cozy to me   it’s not easily overwhelming like a lot of other psychedelics  but don’t make the assumption that bad trips can’t happen   one   trip i had turned really bad due to insecurities i had about other people during the trip  and i ended up having to take a bit of xanax to prevent myself from freaking out   you may assume that it’s entactogenic effects work the exact same way as mdma  but they don’t seem to   on   b  you crave connection to others and interaction feels more meaningful  but for both me and my partner  we noticed that feelings of loneliness or social rejection can be much more intense than when sober   be smart and careful with your dosages and setting  just like any other psychedelic \\n\\ni think it’d be hard for me to trip alone on mid range dosages   at   and lower it’s just a good mood enhancer   at   i really needed to be around people to feel good   but at    the euphoria was pretty constant and came with almost every thought i had   i don’t think i would  need  to be with someone in order to feel it at that point  but it would be preferred   i imagine at higher doses it’s persistent enough to still feel okay while tripping alone  don’t take my word for it though  experiment for yourself \\n\\na really important aspect of the headspace for me is that while it enhances emotions  it always muddies them for me as well   i’m normally very good at analyzing my emotions  and psychedelics usually enhance my ability to do this   i imagine lines being drawn to each thought  i can trace their paths  make them stop  or make them branch in other directions     b consistently prevents me from doing this   it feels as if my thoughts and feelings no longer have borders and clear connections between them  they’re all muddied together in one big soup   i can still explore them  there’s just no longer a good map for it  nor do i have much control over where i go   it also interferes with my critical thinking ability for the same reason   this often makes it much more difficult for me to problem solve my way through anxiety on   b   it became less of a problem at    because i felt like i still intuitively knew what most of my thoughts and feelings meant even though i couldn’t entirely keep track of them  i wouldn’t want to rely on that though \\n\\nafter becoming aware of this effect and getting more used to the headspace of   b  i’ve been able to function in this regard a little better  but it’s still difficult   the inhibition lasts even after the trip ends and gradually goes away over the next few days  sometimes nearly a week   i haven’t heard anyone else describing this effect online  however my trip partner agreed that they also experienced this \\n\\n  nausea   bodyload\\n\\n         even this small dose was pretty rough   i took it on an empty stomach with no ginger and within   minutes my stomach began feeling like it was full of rocks   i had to lay down for the first   minutes and wait for it to settle   it passed though and i had no discomfort afterward \\n\\nafter the trip i had faint muscle tightness but it was gone the next day \\n\\n         at these doses and higher  i took a ginger capsule     minutes before dosing each time   with the ginger  i had no nausea and only mild stomach cramps for the first   minutes after dosing   the cramps would gradually fade and be completely gone by   hours   very easily tolerable \\n\\ni had slight muscle tightness during and after the comedown from stimulation  but it was always gone after sleeping \\n\\n         first time i did this dose  it was on an empty stomach and with two ginger capsules   i had the same mild stomach problems as i did with   \\n\\nsecond time i took this dose  i had eaten half of a chicken sandwich   minutes before dosing  which was a mistake   despite taking ginger with it  i was couch bound for the entire first half of the trip  getting increasingly more nauseous   it only went away when i decided i needed to throw up two and half hours after dosing   although the nausea went away and i made sure to re hydrate myself  i still got pretty bad cramps occasionally for the rest of the trip   thankfully they weren’t bad enough to ruin the experience and i still had a great time \\n\\nmuscle tightness wasn’t any different from   \\n\\n  notes      after my first   dose  i made sure to take it with one or two   powdered ginger capsules i made  which helped significantly   however  my partner  who has a really sensitive stomach  has yet to get much if any stomach discomfort from   b  even without ginger \\n\\n  length\\n\\n     \\n\\nfirst effects    minutes \\n\\npeak        hours \\n\\nsober      hours\\n\\n     \\n\\nfirst effects    minutes   maybe placebo  definite effects at

afterglow\\n\\nthe afterglow actually didn’t change much in strength for me regardless of dose   despite   b’s short duration  the afterglow for both me and my partner lasted several days  sometimes up to a week   i felt a lot of empathogenic feelings and residual warmth pretty strongly for the first two days after the trip  and they would fade over the course of the following few days   the trouble i have with my thoughts being fuzzy and difficult to navigate are equally present during the afterglow though  which isn’t very welcome \\n\\nunlike me  my partner experienced mdma like depression after each trip  although shorter and more mild   as well as the lasting difficulty with thinking \\n\\n  other effects   enhancements\\n\\n  music appreciation     i couldn’t feel the music inside my head as much as other psychedelics   it occasionally created imagery in my head at   but not very much   however  at every dose the emotions of a song had a greater intensity and warmth to them  and contributed more strongly to the overall mood \\n\\n  tactile enhancement     i didn’t get any particular tactile enhancement for things like soft blankets or other inanimate objects  but i did have it mildly with my partner at    and very strongly at     snuggling was easily one of the best parts at   \\n\\n  motor skills     at    motor skills were perfectly normal   at    they were only mildly affected   considering how high i otherwise was at    it doesn’t seem to inhibit my coordination much compared to other substances \\n\\n  enjoying food     i never felt the need to eat but i really enjoyed it when i did  a bit better than sober \\n\\n  dancing     i’m normally kind of awkward and have never been one for dancing  but   b made it much easier and even enjoyable  especially at     \\n\\n  tolerance     i haven’t re dosed on   b but according to friends  they won’t feel a reduction in effects until a third consecutive dose   on one occasion my partner also tripped on lsd the day after doing   of   b and felt no reduction in effects \\n\\n  compared to mdma\\n\\nwere the entactogenic qualities at any dose comparable to mdma   not really   not because they weren’t as strong  but because they just felt so different   for reference  i have only done doses of   of mdma  and i’ll be making comparisons based off of   of   b \\n\\n  social interactions   euphoria     mdma gave me a soft  warm  gentle love for everyone and everything around me   it almost completely got rid of any social anxiety   it stopped me from overthinking my interactions but at the same time made me so emotionally aware of everything going on   it turned what would normally be an incredibly anxious situation into something that felt easy  natural  and even enjoyable   the euphoria was clear  honest  simple  and pure \\n\\nwhile   b encouraged human interaction and generally made it easier and more enjoyable  i was still somewhat prone to overthinking things and when it anxiety hit  it hit  hard    the euphoric warmth and love on   b is so much more intense in a way that’s difficult to describe   it doesn’t have the honest purity of mdma  nor does it have the deep emotional clarity   it’s more complex  but at the same time more muddied and confusing   it’s so intense and up in your face but the lack of coherence makes it    in a way  more difficult to take comfort in   this isn’t to say that it’s not enjoyable  because i still very much enjoyed it  it’s just such a different experience \\n\\n  tactile enhancement     tactile enhancement is also different between the two   for   b  it was much more physically intense but i only felt it with my partner   for mdma  it was a more broad enhancement that applied to lots of different things   it was strongest with my partner  less physically intense  but softer and more emotional   for me personally  i’d prefer the tactile enhancement of mdma  but they’re different \\n\\n  therapeutic purposes     i think mdma is generally easier to use as a tool for therapy   on mdma my emotions were so much more easily understood  flawlessly communicated  and i had no fear talking about them  even when it was about something difficult     b still causes me anxiety in difficult situations and understanding my emotions is even more difficult than when sober   however  that’s not to say it doesn’t have therapeutic value   two of my friends have both used   b to process trauma that they couldn’t before and also to better understand their relationships with others \\n\\n  summary\\n\\ni’m not someone who’s typically very interested in entactogens and stimulants  so i wanted to do   b for it’s psychedelic effects   because of this  i really didn’t think i liked

       "  '500': 'i want to preface this with   things \\n\\n   i m tripping rn  apologies \\n\\n   it s funny to me that i usually think to myself  why is this person on reddit rn  when i read posts like this  but here we are \\n\\nanyway  today didn t go exactly according to plan but it is nice  \\n\\nso my partner and i both work from home and as a result have been spending a lot of time together at the expense of alone time  today she had an appointment in the afternoon and was planning to spend some time after that shopping and just generally being out and about  and i was gonna hang out at home anywhere else \\n\\nafter she had left and i finished up some work stuff  i thought  ok tite what should i do now  it looks like it s gonna rain so i don t want to go out there \\n\\nafter not very much thought i considered doing some ketamine and listening to music   maybe hole  maybe not  either way just vibe for an hour or so  \\n\\nas i was getting out the k  i started eyeing the   b  i had read reports that hbr  which i have  doesn t hurt as badly as hcl  which i have had previously    so i thought  fuck it  and got out about   of that  \\n\\nso i made some lines totaling approx   mg ket  added the   b to one of those  and thought here we go  \\n\\nit was expectedly very nice  also did not hurt   very badly   \\n\\ni laid down with some headphones and music and was lost in the cevs and generally being on another plane of existence  \\n\\nafter i guess like   mins i was getting some messages so i looked at my phone  a few were from work so i ignored the shit out of those  but some were from my partner  apparently it did in fact rain  and directly on top of her before the appointment  no less   i was listening to music with my eyes closed so i didn t notice the passing storm \\n\\n so instead of her having a nice afternoon  she is soaking wet and in a  rightfully  bad mood   she doesn t want to go shopping anymore and says she wants  to come back home rather than slog around in wet shoes and jeans  fair  of course i understand and really just want her to have the best day she can  in the end she decides to stop by the supermarket then head home \\n\\ni m bummed that she isn t having a good time  but was able to let her vent a bit and think hopefully she ll be able to turn her day around  \\n\\nmeanwhile i m turnt as shit   i could barely see my phone during that whole text exchange and was hoping that i made as much sense as i assumed i did  \\n\\na big pro of ketamine dissociatives is the ability it gives one to just  carry on  and not attach your personal emotions to things  which is usually not the case with psychedelics in my experience  so after confirming she s ok  i  laid back down and got back into the music immediately  \\n\\nafter a little bit i started to realize i had to kind of make moves since she would be home soon  my partner and i both use substances  together and separately  but i hadn t told her about today because it was a last minute decision  and she had a really shitty afternoon so i didn t want to bring her wrath upon me by telling her i was actually having a grand ol  time  i thought it best to just keep this one discreet and give her some much needed alone time when she got home  so i planned to grab an umbrella  head to the park and hope for the best  \\n\\nthis is about   ish hours from the very start  so the ket is mostly gone but i m very much on   b \\n\\nas i was pumping myself up to leave  she called me from downstairs asking me to let her in because she can t find her key  dang ok of course no problem  i step into the hall  triple check that i locked the apartment  and press the elevator button  i was not expecting a person to be there when it opened   so i kind of scared myself and then apologized to the guy  and got in anyway   \\n\\nget to the bottom of the elevator and when it opens there is my partner  she had found her key after all  i realized i forgot an umbrella so i went back up with her  \\n\\nat this point it really looks like it s going to rain again  so i decided against going to the park  but i still wanted to get out of the apartment for a little  what small task could i do   of course going to the bank is the best idea  \\n\\nso i grab my debit card  umbrella and keys and head out  it was the first time i was outside today so that was nice  it was def gonna rain so there was a sense of urgency to the mission  but in a fun way  \\n\\nso i get to the bank  and this is the first time i have been to this particular bank since mine is not around here but i needed to get some cash  i saw an empty atm so i went up to it and put my card in  at that point did i decide to look at the giant words on the screen  not in service   lol so i m like  oh  and then back up and wait for one of the other   people at the working atms to finish  i successfully completed the task  put the cash and card safely in my zipper pocket and head out  the security guard who witnessed the whole ordeal was probably like wtf is wrong with this guy \\n\\ni made it back to the building just in time before a crazy thunderstorm  i dropped the money off  made sure my partner didn t need anything  and came down to a common area to chill  while sitting here listening to music i decided to write this post  \\n\\nthanks for reading if you made it this far  i hope you have an awesome day    i m also not going to read this so i hope it makes sense   \\n\\n\\ntldr    spontaneously combo d   b and ketamine when i thought i would have the place to myself for a few hours  i did not  in fact  have the place to myself for a few hours but had a great time anyway   recommend this combo  also snorting   b hbr doesn t hurt as badly as hcl

       "  '1938': 'a while ago i had gotten my hands on a load of different rc s  one of which was mxp  i had aquired an entire gram and decided i was going to try and hole on mxp  looking back i wasnt aware of dissociative mania until i got these chems and was in the midst of the lingering mania of opce  mxipr   tiletamine       and other dissociatives i used the previous week  combined with novel psychedelics of all sorts  such as doc          and others along with some novel chems like    only smoked the chemical  to which it was mildly interesting and i even managed to nod out with the chemical at high doses  the fast onset and combination with my fixation on smoking chems it was interesting  however even from smoking less than a quarter gram over a while i would get nasty slimey lungs  but i do not have noticable lingering effects and i wouldnt repeat it \\n\\nso anyways i had mostly run through my stash only to find few gave any experience close to the hole  thats when i researched about mxp and found conflicting reports that the hole was attainable at   while others said it was    some even saying it was   grams  now mxp and related diarylethylamines are interesting but mild dissociatives in lower doses so the impression is that they arent very strong to the seasoned dissocistive user  this experience would prove that you could attain the diarryls equivelant of the hole  but one should note this is not similar to the k hole  rather the mxp hole manifested in a very different way  \\n\\nso i took   orally after a   dose didnt do much for me  figuring i didnt have enough material to do titration like many have the fortune to do  however in retrospect this was absolutely silly  but again keep in mind my manic state  \\n\\nwhen i say it is interesting i mean that the hole is not like ketamine where one was anesthatized unable to move  rather i was very able to move about  but still my internal self  the observer that comes to dissociate from your physical actions would experience a rotating effect  one that would present very quickly in the trip and linger the entire experience  \\n\\nthis was in contrast to ketamines classic freefall motion of the observer  no i was very able to move about my house with some effort  \\n\\ni did record some notes and idk where else to incorporate them  keep in mind i was still able to make notes and record them  a testament to this chemicals lucidity \\n\\n    ingest   orally \\n\\n    im feeling sort of dissociated but a rather bland one  \\n\\n    oh yeah im feeling it  i can see the room spinning  it looks like dizzy vison x   but im bot dizzy  i can stand  when i sit though i still slowly feel like my body is rotating if i close my eyes and meditate  its a cool effect\\n\\n    its getting really strong so i decide to smoke a cannabis bowl and a joint  im thoroughly baked  \\n\\n    the spinning effect has begun to increase  or rather i has been increasing but its exponentially increasing  i can still sort of stop it or slow it if i open my eyes and focus  i look at my walls and they are shifting like some psychedelics  its notable but actually fairly weak  \\n\\n    oh my god the rotation isnt stopping and it feels like im rotating my entire body  if i sit up on my bed it feels like my legs rotatr through my bed  like a noclip  impossible  \\n\\ntime stops its meaning as the rotation effect becomes stronger  im unable to keep time until    in so im just summarizing my gibbrish as best i can\\n\\nthe rotation effect is all i can focus my mind on   i write  e    this idbt fun anymore  im unsurr the time stamp bit the writing is obvious  this isnt fun anymore  oh boy was this true  \\n\\nnot necisarily a bad trip but i wouldnt mind if you could stop a dissociative like benzos do to psychs right now  something that no other dissociative has made me want  to end the experience  \\n\\nthe visuals are strong as the drifting becomes strong\\n\\ni explicitly remember getting up and walking to the bathroom  when i sit on the toilet i close my eyes and still see my bathroom and like earlier i feel my legs rotating through the toilet  i also see it visually and to my horror when i open my eyes im still rotating through my toilet  i need somewhere to rotate in peace and the bathroom is always a safe space for me during drug experiences  \\n\\ngod let me leave roto world  i think as i relentlessly rotate   degress through my toilet despite if my eyes are open or closed  \\n\\nin retro spect these effects are quite novel but in the moment it just got old after a while  not something id chase like the k hole  \\n\\nnotes at     i feel like the rotatiob effect and trip is declining  its been   hours and tge peak is over but this rotation is sticking around  will i rotate for an entire   hours now  \\n\\ni send a message to my discord friends that im stuck in rotoworld  unable to elaborate further  they meme and just send funny messages like  r o t a t i o n  and shit  \\n\\n    oh my god its finally weak again but my god in still spinning internally  \\n\\n    the effects are over  a strong after glow is present  rotation effect has stopped  im not nauseous or anything  just fucking glad im not rotating through my bed and toilet anymore  glad my desire to stop this dissociative hole was fulfilled\\n\\nin summary  dont hole with this chem  unless idk itd a unique effect  but fuck me that was awfully persistent to not be a common effect  jesus fuck man  slightly cringe when i think of it\\n\\nplease let me know if you got any mxp experiences

take it here  she doesn t mind  i felt a bit disoriented because i didn t want to just whip out a nasal spray and give it to her  i think i was worried about security  so we just stood up and walked a bit to a more darker part of the outside area of the club and she took like   more sprays at once there  she was already starting to feel slightly the effects of the first   sprays from   mins ago i guess  but nothing intense i d say   \\n\\n\\n             wow this got really intense really quick  when inside the club on the dance floor  due to hypnotic sounds of the music and strobing lights  i was looking at people differently  the dancers were starting to look like a real motion blur mess  and their moves literally felt like a sped up gif image  same thing with the bartender  anybody doing anything repetitive and  on the corner of my vision  felt like a fast looped video  the club at this time was much more packed and the crowd was quite diverse  and actually a lot of them seemed pretty energetic and in a real party mood  i was tripped out a bit by it because i honestly didn t expect that much people on this event  and usually the people aren t that energetic  so it felt as i m really imagining things and stuff started to freak me out   \\n\\n\\ni decided to talk to a bartender who i know there  and i told him i m not exactly feeling fine  i already asked him before if i seem odd  and he said not really  you seem normal  why  so i told him i took some stuff tonight  anyways  due to me feeling strange and overwhelmed  i decided to give him my nasal spray in case i decide to look for some medical help or something and i didn t want anything on me   even though   b fly is not scheduled here  but yeah  try explaining that to whoever   \\n\\n\\nhe told me to sit down on a seat and not to worry  we all know each other here and they would keep an eye on me  i thanked him for that and proceeded to sit down  when i sat down i tried to lean on the wall and it felt like the wall was sooo far away from my back haha  when i leaned back and closed my eyes  i was just thinking about how i took too much  but i was aware i was just high and this is irrational paranoia  but still very annoying  i could look back onto my last time i smoked weed  and similar thoughts occurred  but back then i didn t even know it was possible  so it was good to have that  bad  experience behind me to reference to   \\n\\n\\nthe other bartender was asking me if i could move away  and i was like  but he said its fine for me to sit here   and she just explained its a fridge and it is fine  but she just needed to get something out of it  i was like oh ok sorry  didn t know  and i proceeded to go outside  i found a guy who i know as a somewhat regular club visitor  and i asked him to walk with me  he was also aware i was on something  and he said yea sure  lets go   \\n\\n\\n             he and i are walking around outside the club  luckily its not a busy street  i tell him i just needed a change of scenery to break the monotony of the music and dancing  he understood   \\n\\n\\ni actually think this was when the peak really was kicking because i was really freaking out internally and i even ended up asking him if he wants to come over to my place to chill for a bit  or if there s a chance i could sleep over at his place because i don t trust myself to go back home on my own  he politely declined because another friend was staying over at his place and soon asked if we can go back to the club as he is pretty tired and plans on going home soon  i said i understand  i m sorry i m just not feeling that great right now  he calmed me down a bit  reminded me i m at a familiar place and that people are friendly there  also when i asked him to go over at his place  i was thinking how stupid and desperate this is  and that i really need to  stop  worrying and just be in the place where i m surrounded by people so in case something bad happens  they are around me   \\n\\n\\nas we are walking back  i notice how the street seems a bit stretched  i see breathing distortions on the leaves on trees  and the music from the club is still pretty clear  even though we are like   from the club    \\n\\n\\n             we return to the club  i find george and we are dancing  i just tell him  man you are not yet feeling what i am feeling  dancing feels really good  for lack of better description  it felt like my body expanded  and i was dancing inside my own  expanded shell   it was feeling like  for every   dance move i do  its like i only did it once in reality  its as the whole sensation of movement etc was just delayed for a few seconds  and as the sensation happened  its as if it clashed with what i was doing at the moment  i e  if i m swing my head left right  and i do a quick swing  its as if the   heads met in the middle and collided or something     \\n\\n\\n i spoke about this with george later the next day  and asked him if he felt the same way on lsd and he said yes  so i assume this has something to do with time feeling slowed down  i still don t exactly know which  sensation  was the true one  the one that i was doing or the one i was feeling  i do assume it was the one i am doing  and its just  the exact same thing that i would end up feeling  but just seconds later   \\n\\n\\n             i am a bit worried by dancing  because i don t feel any physical exhaustion  and i do not want to overheat or overdo it  even though i am pretty  experienced  with more energical dancing when i m sober  but i really didn t want to test my luck  i decide its best for me to be moving pretty frequently and to break the monotony of doing repetitive dancing in just one spot  although it really feels nice  i take out my hand fan  and i do fast movements with it  and it feels as if its constant wind hitting me instead of just fast movements  i believe the whole  slowed down sensations  aren t just delayed once by   step  but also kind of  blended  together with the multiple steps of delay  kinda like the initial tracers where i saw my hand   times instead of    i look at my own shadow while i m dancing and its not really matching with the moves i m doing  i m mellowly bumping my head  but in the shadows it looks like i m going really hard  so again  not sure what to trust  really confusing  i decide to get away a bit   \\n\\n\\n             i see maria and luke  maria offers me a hit of her vape  i never did this  but it feels really nice and flavorful  i ask them to go out and walk for a bit  we do that and we go and sit outside somewhere  luke and i are locals  and maria is a tourist  so i try and keep the conversation in english so she wouldn t feel left out  me and luke unfortunately say a few words in our native language and i see this kinda put her off  i apologize and keep on speaking english  she is definitely starting to feel more intense too  not on my level  but we are laughing  and luke just looks at us  smiles and says  man you guys are definitely feeling it   i look back at maria and i say  yeah we sure are  and she laughs and nods in agreement  unfortunately luke didn t take any more than the   initial sprays  and he was tired  so he never got to experience the effects as we did  after   or so minutes  we go back inside   \\n\\n\\n             i see george again sitting on the table smoking on a cigarette  looking like a broken gif again  i say hey whats up  you feeling all good  his response was positive   \\n\\n\\ni don t remember exactly what i was doing after that but i assume i went to dance a bit again   \\n\\n\\n             as i m dancing  i keep trying to do different stuff  go around the bar  get a glass of ice to chew on and to melt in my hands and put it on my head etc  drink water  chat with the bartender and james  i ask james for his sweet candy as he usually brings some sweets  the candy really tastes nice  it was slightly sour and like made of  powder  so it was dissolving really nicely  i was also sucking lollipops  and chewing gum  i think i didn t like the chewing gum a lot as it was the most repetitive  and was kinda contradictory to my  breaking the monotony  thing  i invited james for a short walk too  we also sat down and spoke a bit about life  talked about what we do  etc     \\n\\n\\n             we come back  i think around this time or slightly before is when the actual open eye visuals got more present  the stuff was morphing a little bit and there was an organic vibrating pattern on rocks  leaves  my phone that i put into  sleep mode  that makes the screen black and white  is slightly now colored with the colors of the surrounding object  i was happy and interested that i am seeing this  also i saw some  infinite mirror  effects on like geometric shapes like the table legs  it felt like there was   of them instead of    the clothing of some people is interesting  i remember a leopard skin like pattern on some girl  and from a distance it felt like it was split in a few dresses instead of     \\n\\n\\n             i m chilling a bit in outside area  chatting with random people about who knows what  but i m not feeling really comfortable by chatting with them  i feel as they are judging me and talking to me like i m dumb and for their own entertainment and are secretly laughing about me  i overhear some conversation where they are talking about ecstasy and a guy says  yeah he says he doesn t have any  yeah right     and i immediately think they are talking about me so i go away  some guy comes up to me and is shouting some football shit  and asks me if i called him a big fat ugly bald head  i say no no no i didn t  but then i think   wait did i  i don t want any trouble   i assume they were just fucking with me so i just removed myself from there and went back inside   \\n\\n\\n             dancing again  anytime i feel like pausing  i feel like people around me are judging me  time really feels slow  i have no internet so i don t have anything to really read or chat with somebody  i don t even have some games on my phone that don t feel repetitive   \\n\\n\\ni decide to take out my earphones and watch a full movie as that will help the time pass lol  as i take out my earphones i realize how stupid this looks  who goes to a club and watches a movie instead of dancing   that must look really strange from other people s perspective  so i stop with that too  i guess just dancing  going to the toilet for water and walking around club and sitting at emptier spots is the routine i should go for   basically literally the exact same shit i d do if i was sober  except i wouldn t feel so self conscious about it  and wouldn t give   shits what others think of me   \\n\\n\\nby this time maria and luke have gone back to their apartment   \\n\\n\\n             it s still nighttime  the music is still going hard  it s really unbelievable how much people there still is  usually around this time this club is left with half of the people that were there by      it feels like there s even new people coming in  at   moment it feels really crowded  and then it feels not so crowded  i really thought i m imagining people that are filling up the dance floor and that there is realistically   less people than what i m seeing  i find george and he sits next to me  and he holds his head and says  what the fuck  i definitely did not expect this    i m like  yep  we definitely need to talk about this when we are sober   as i stop talking to him  and turn my head and stand up  i see him just inhale the cigarette and looking so mind blown  and all i can think is   \\n\\n\\n damn  in that   second that i turned my head and he inhaled that smoke  he probably just had another   random thoughts go through his mind  that s super cool  and it feels like i am seeing myself through his actions    \\n\\n\\n            party still going strong  george left around this time  but i didn t see when  throughout the night i was curious on how his and maria s night is going  if they are all good  i really didn t want to be blamed if something bad happens  but at the same time  i said to myself  its their path  i am leading my own now  i just hope for the best  but i cannot think about this right now   he was mostly like a reference point for me  we took the same dose  although my peak hit earlier than his  as i was already   sprays in  by the time he took his initial    but seeing him not freak out  was also calming to me  even though his actions seemed perhaps a bit strange to me  like the broken gif cigarette smoking   he seemed really calm and normal  so if he wasn t visibly panicking  i  probably  have no reason to either   \\n\\n\\n             the party is supposed to end in    i am still astonished by how many people there still is  so i ask the bartender for a ballpark figure  and he says lets go count them  i try and tell him don t do that  its fine  so he just looks at the dance floor in kind of an awe  and says  about     i m still shocked and i could say he was pretty surprised too  because i don t think either of us expected that much people at this time  but at least he confirmed that there indeed is that many people and i am not imagining   \\n\\n\\nthere was also another guy who i know as a regular  he was pretty high and drunk  and he was talking to me on the bench  but he kept leaning towards me and his head was hitting my head  i really wasn t sure if it was him who was bumping into me or was it me who is bumping into him  his friend approached us and was trying to give him a bottle of water  i took it out of her hand because he wasn t registering her presence at all and tried to give it to him myself  i then stood up and actually asked her if she was trying to give it to me or him  she said it was for him  he is with her and he is just really high and drunk  i said  oh okay and went away to dance   \\n\\n\\n             end of the night  it s sunrise  the dj was spinning all night alone  insanely good techno  he s definitely my favorite local dj  and i m happy that he got the crowd he deserved  i am a bit sad that i kinda wasn t dancing as much as i wanted to and i missed some parts of the music due to going around and focusing on my thoughts instead of just trying to forget about it and enjoy   \\n\\n\\ni am also glad that he was the only one playing that night because he has insane selection and skill  but i assume if there were multiple dj s  it would ve helped me with keeping up time  but honestly  having him be the only one  was super dope and just added to the trippy experience   \\n\\n\\ni say bye to the bartender and i say i ll come next week to get my nasal spray  he should just keep it until then   \\n\\n\\n             i arrive to the bus station  i am feeling the urge to pee  but i can hold it in  visuals are still present  but not that intense  the  long streets and long walks  are still present  also some cars and buses felt compressed  i get on the bus that arrives  and it goes just   station and literally everybody gets off of it  i think to myself  wow damn am i this disgusting that people literally got off because i got in    in reality the next stop of the bus was kinda the final one and it was like in a dead end street  so nobody needed to go there  i realized fuck  i took the wrong bus  now i have to walk to the next station  as i was walking  there was a jogger running  and as he passed me  it really took   seconds for me to feel the impact of the wind breeze he just created by running past me  really cool  the taillights of cars and leaves on the pavement were still morphing and breathing   \\n\\n\\n             i arrived to the next bus station  and as i did  it felt everybody is looking at me  some lady even did a praying gesture and moved out of my way  as soon as the first bus came  everybody from the station got into it  but it wasn t the bus i was going into  that again made me a feel a bit sad and disgusting  then the actual bus i needed came and it took me where i needed to go  i was contemplating crossing the street while the light was red because there was almost no traffic  but i didn t  because i said to myself  don t do anything you wouldn t do sober   \\n\\n\\nas i entered the building  i looked at myself in the elevator mirror  my pupils were still very dilated  but the iris looked like it was breathing  not much visual distortion on the face  as i got into the apartment  i rushed into the toilet and had the piss of my life   \\n\\n\\n             i am laying in my bed chilling  and i still have some slight distortions  birds and tree leafs in the wind sound great  the corner of my vision is flashing like a strobe light  but i am finally definitely coming down  i see that maria followed me on instagram and we proceed to chat for like   hours exchanging our experience  she is still higher than me because she took it later  i believe she and her friend left and joined a group of native speaking friends maybe slightly even before she hit the actual peak  so she was kinda  surrounded by not so familiar people that are speaking a foreign language and it was freaking her out a bit because she felt like they might be talking about her  she says she would laugh a lot and then she would think they are looking at her weirdly and then she would feel like crying  lots of mixed emotions  i asked her what she would rate this drug experience like and what she would compare it to  she said     and it felt like there were   stages peaks to it  first the mdma  then lsd and at the end mushrooms   \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\noverall  i am very glad i did this  although i do feel i took too much for the first time  especially arriving alone and without an actually close friend that i could count on  and also at a club where everything is a bit repetitive by nature  it was very trippy  sound was amazing  the body feeling while dancing too   \\n\\n\\ngranted  i was scared for myself at times  but more so of the fact what people are thinking of me  and not the actual physical effects  but that fear was also present as i didn t want to overdo myself   \\n\\n\\ni also would rate it a     at this dose  i just wished i had some experience to compare it to  even though i haven t done lsd or mushrooms  both george and maria are saying that its definitely closer to that than to mdma  and i do agree  it s really unique and interesting  also i d say its a pretty  dynamic  ride  its not like a constant thing  the emotions and feelings can change quite quickly   \\n\\n\\nit just also bothered me a bit that i wasn t dancing much with random people  as anybody unfamiliar trying to dance with me  felt a bit fake and like a mockery of me  so i ended up dancing by myself in the corner of the dance floor quite a lot \\n\\n amp    \\n\\nand for the end of the story  the  track  https   www youtube com watch v    that the dj played  and which will forever remind me of this experience and give me goosebumps  in my opinion really perfectly summarizes my whole experience of that night  going through the crowd paranoid  dancing in repetitive motions and having people look like broken gifs  just unreal   \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  tl dr        first time psychedelic experience  scary at times  but super fun and grateful when looking back at it  body high was amazing  visuals too  no nausea  pants just felt a bit heavy and as if they are falling below my crotch  the first time paranoia due to headspace was scary  nothing completely unmanageable though   \\n\\n\\nnext time i will go for a lower dose  and probably revisit this dose again in the same setting with a company of a sober friend sometime later in the future   \\n\\n\\nthanks for reading ',\n",

made a massive mistake  which i would never repeat  i also wondered why people on earth people do this drug recreationally \\n\\nfirst thing i need to point out is that i take anti convulsant drugs due to a seizures disorder which i acquired a few years ago  this condition surfaced most likely due to benzo abuse  but my first seizure and the resulting hospital visit revealed a venous brain abnormality which i had surgery on to repair  i have had   further seizures since the first but i have not had any since i quit benzos about     years ago  so i take sodium valproate and lamotrigine for the seizures  i also take venlafaxine  mirtazapine and dexamphetamine for depression  anxiety  and adhd  yeah  i know its a lot  but it s working well so i wont be changing it any time soon     \\n\\ni decided i wanted to a pcp analogue because the previously mentioned drugs i use limited the type of recreational drugs that could provide any enjoyable effects  having read a number of experience reports on various dissociatives  i decided i wanted to try   ho pcp and   meo pcp  i had tried dxm many times in my early   s  most of which were positive but a few of my later high dose experiences had me thinking i was dying  maybe it was just a panic attack  maybe i was in some kind of physiological distress  i dont know and my memory of the experience was always unclear \\n\\nback to the experience  i started off with an orally ingested allergy test approx       after   hours had passed without any perceivable effect decided to take what i thought was a fairly low dose  i had bought a solution which claimed to be     per ml and from the i ingested what should have been    only the guy who sold it to me knows if the solution was accurate  and maybe he doesnt even know \\n\\nafter an hour i started to feel a building anticipation fear nervousness  in hindsight it was a little like the feeling i get before an mdma experience is about to begin it s been a long time   but its also similar to the feeling i get before i have a seizure or a panic attack  i was either facing impending doom or euphoric wonder \\n\\ni decided i needed to do something to prevent me from having a seizure and all i could think of that i had on hand was beer  i had previously read a number of reports of people mixing this drug with alcohol and they did not mention any adverse effects  but in hindsight they may have just been the ones that survived  \\n\\ni quickly downed   beers as my body began to feel like a foreign vessel i was inhabiting  i was sitting in front of the tv but i couldnt look at it directly because it was hard to perceive its proportions  and i was feeling confused and overwhelmed  the beer wasn t chilling me out like it normally would  i wanted to stay grounded but i felt myself floating away  what the story with this drug i wonder  i dont feel any euphoria  this is not what i was expecting from what i had read  after reading this drug could cause mania  stimulation  compulsive redosing  anxiety suppression and euphoria  i was hoping it would feel similar to an amphetamine or cathinone type drug \\n\\n amp    \\n\\nmy wife asked me to join her for a walk and i thought it might help me stick to this reality which i felt like i was slipping away from  i fucked around for about   minutes moving random shit around and getting dressed multiply times to feel like i had a grip on things before i set off  i dont think my wife had figured out i had taken anything yet  she is usually very perceptive at the slightest hint that im inebriated \\n\\nmy spatial perception was distorted and i was surprised i was able to walk straight  as we walked i continued to feel confused and distant from the world around me  i remembered a reddit post i saw which showed an animation or computer game of what it felt like to be on pcp which i felt was very accurate  it felt like i was on the set on grand theft auto and i now understood why people thought the pcp experience was very comical  even though i wasn t feeling it  i heard some birds fly above me and their squawking felt digital and metallic if that makes any sense to ya \\n\\n amp

if i was dead or in a coma somewhere else and i was in some other realm  was my wife in on this deception  was i just now beginning to reveal the fact that everyone in my life was in on some conspiracy and i was just a fool  a puppet that had fucked up big time  i had experiences these thoughts before while tripping  but i cant remember what substance i was on at the time  \\n\\n amp

take my mind off things  two hours after i first felt the effects i began feeling ok again  and   hours later i was fine \\n\\n amp    \\n\\nso what am i missing here  have i been to quick to give up

       "  '5997': 'forewarning  this post is super long  i hope it’s worth it \\n\\nyou sound like me  i can hardly tolerate more than skimming your post  the experience is so familiar  tell me your symptoms if you like by dm  my life went off the rails slightly and   fma pushed it off the rest of the way  i was using excess stims but functional and missed that i was using too much diazepam and one horrible period phenazepam  i may be one of the few people who survived that drug without blackout and it confused me into thinking i didn’t have a problem because it lasts literally days  so every three day use was skyrocketing my tolerance and i hadn’t a clue  \\n\\none covid later and my wife and i had issues we needed to resolve and we briefly had a magical spring reconnecting during the first and second confinements  that broke again sept   and my background stim and benzo self medication became a full on rc cocktail that obliterated me  methylphenidate   to   mg   d insufflated to increase potency so it’s worse than it sounds  i topped that off with flourinated amphetamines and the workhorse was   fma with   fea mixed for some serotonin because   fma is dry  occasionally i used   fa because it has a lower half life but generally it looked like   mg   d   fma  those two stims plus bupropion plus diazepam or etizolam until i was taking six to eight mg etizolam relatively constantly because it had grave interdose withdrawal  that started to cause brain zaps at onset and night terrors during withdrawal  the biggest poison most of the time was the stim use  my life had become very difficult and it killed my emotions very effectively  \\n\\nthere was some   ho pcp daily for additional numbing and at some points when i was odd that i used healthier dissociative a like dmxe  the stims ruined me though  i lost the ability to think entirely  i took a job that would have been trivial when well and i had so little short term memory i could not remember a sentence to write or edit  i literally forgot sentences or their meaning while writing \\n\\nthere are more details but you know the rest  i have been in withdrawal… i was going to say nine months but it’s approaching a year  i am on my last   mg   d diazepam and nothing else except antidepressants that help  zero stims  out of dissociatives  and i’ve been in the united states to finish withdrawal and because europe was a trap at that time  right now when i’m okay my memory is back  my emotions and personality are back  i am dealing with mild dyslexia and some brain fog but it’s pretty hard to notice unless i’m in a withdrawal wave \\n\\nso look  it’s going to come back  think of this as an opportunity to master suffering and grief and fear and you’re going to be back mostly good as new  but the grit you’re going to get makes up for any deficits  fight and win  try to use your brain  i know this is stupid sounding but quit entirely trying to fix your total brain fog and force yourself to remember something  stop using your phone as external memory if you use it that way  even track time through the day in your head and orientate yourself so that you’re pushing a bit against whatever is resisting you  when it hurts  kill it  hold your headspace  \\n\\nmy recovery involved a lot of   meo dmt and it taught me self awareness and discipline and to hold my mind and my identity even in ego death  i think i used it daily for a year and burned through   freebase  i do not recommend it but the point is find some traction  it can be small  it doesn’t matter what it is  then try to hold yourself emotionally stable and ground yourself in your senses  if you can’t think  take five minutes and go someplace happy if you can or just there take one minute to focus completely on each sense  you look and all you do is look  you smell and all you do is smell  feel the externality of it  realize you’re safe in the moment because you’re alive  that has to be enough during the period you can’t think  you get tools over time and this goes into remission  \\n\\ndo not force yourself to do something or beat yourself up if you can’t  take a month or two off if you physically can  if not  practice grounding in the senses and practice retaining your ability to hold yourself okay when the pain or fear is there  so it’s working from both sides  experience externality through each sense  and grit up to get through when it hurts  this worked for me  \\n\\nalso  non pcx dissociatives literally saved my life  if you want to take risks  you can see if microdosing l or analogs helps you  if you’re already good with psychedelics they can be healing  they can also really fuck you up  if you can hold a good headspace they can do self work and improve cognition  but honestly it’s a gamble so if you haven’t used them either microdose only and see if it helps or just leave them be and be sober  you are going to suffer  it is going to be unpleasant  you will feel totally broken and alone and miserable \\n\\nif you can be totally substance free  that’s great  with the caveat that i think everyone should have ideally esketamine on hand but if not  dck or dmxe  dissociatives aren’t just dissociatives  they eliminate suicidal ideation within five minutes of onset if you know how to make a nasal spray  or if you eat them  it takes a bit longer but it works  oddly enough  i know this is rc land but pharma esketamine in low doses improves my cognition and emotional state  do not go anywhere near a   sub pcx or o pce  if you’re already in trouble  it is delirium land and you’re going to wake up a few months later after constantly redosing  which sounds like it’s something you do \\n\\nso  collect yourself  remember you’re going to survive and be okay but it’s going to take a while  you gather up your small armamentarium of an emergency dissociative for pain and potentially derealization or suicidal ideation  if   meo dmt is an option for you  you could very gently test it because i used that and dissociative as circuit breakers when shit gets rough  do not touch a benzo  and if you’re on them  it gets a bit harder but the fun part is you get to suffer more  own it  be angry at it  seriously  feel rage at your cognitive state and direct that rage at the drugs that caused it  anger is one of the only healthy emotions that can be summoned that gives energy and helps you fight  so you have your rage and grit  your grounding in externality  your circuit breakers and potentially practice drugs if they work for you  and otherwise be totally sober if you can \\n\\ni know this will sound unpleasant  and also it’s not a good idea  but i got so angry at what drugs had done to me and my marriage that i rage quit all stimulants  all opiates—literally everything that was not my personal psychedelic praxis    mg plus or minus a bit  plugged to save resources naturally  massive stims  all gone  i had to keep the benzo because you cannot rage quit a   mg habit  i slept about twelve to fifteen hours over ten days  it was one of the most physically painful experiences i had  and i think it taught me a lot about managing despair and pain  i am just saying this because i had to do it and it’s a terrible idea not to taper  but that was where i picked my battle and i fucking killed it  \\n\\nthen naturally i had all of your symptoms  i think regaining working memory consolidating to other forms of storage took about six months and cut to   mg   day to accomplish  this is the first time i’ve been myself in years  \\n\\nit would be good to see a doctor but i think you might not have posted it if you have access to a good one  so you do what you have to alone if none will work with you  find a good gp and neurologist and you’ll be set sooner  but depending on where you live it might honestly not be possible \\n\\nyou are going to win and be yourself again  hold that and fight and win even if you can’t think  you can beat this and it sucks \\n\\nno tl dr because it’s too long for me to reread  read the damn essay and take care and ignore everything i said if it doesn’t work for you  have faith you will find your personal strategies and go with it \\n\\ngo succeed  you have got this  suffer and win your life back  write me if you like  i’m here  good luck my friend ',\n",

tryptamines go and was probably an inevitable development  propyl groups have been paired with methyl  ethyl  and other propyl groups   mpt  ept  and dpt respectively   isopropyl groups have also been paired with methyl  ethyl  and other isopropyl groups  mipt  the elusive eipt  and dipt   it was a matter of time before they would get matched with each other  yielding pipt  pipt    ho pipt  and   meo pipt found their way onto the market at around the same time but commanded little interest and saw little use or demand  it was only recently that samples of them crossed my path \\n\\nthe one i was most excited to try was   ho pipt  in any base tryptamine there’s a general pattern  where the base compound has an intense  and sometimes fairly mild  unique character  the   meo analogue tends to be less visual and more intensive in the body  and the   ho   aco analogue yields more of a well rounded visual and traditional psychedelic experience  so of course  in the name of seeking something satisfactory  i went for   ho pipt first \\n\\nthe basics is that it was short and intense  confusing and hard to comprehend with a strong visual edge and bodyload  it was a strange and worthwhile experience though it did not particularly stand out among its other   substituted tryptamine compatriots   for reference i have tried   ho met    aco ho det    aco mpt    ho aco ept    aco

there is an odd sense of flow and weight in my body almost like i have taken a dissociative  though it lacks in the analgesia and mental sense of dissociation  it s as if i m made of a heavy syrup \\n\\nthere is some abdominal discomfort now and i am starting to shake my limbs  i find it hard to sit still  there is a compulsion to stand up and pace around \\n\\n     there lot of swirling sickness  tension in my head tugging at my abdomen  it’s like the drug is plucking on my vagus nerve like a harpstring  visuals arise suddenly with great intensity  building to a peak seemingly out of nowhere as discomfort continues to tremble its way up my limbs  my laptop screen is pulsing with bright concentric flashes in the dark of my room  iridescent like an oil slick on the night  pareidolic forms emerge from the walls  great stoic  empty faces cast in a deep turquoise and violet glow  blank inhuman expressions of unfeeling colossi  veins of neon flow between them  each black word on the white screen ripples with concentric bands of dark and light colors  the nausea is at points overwhelming\\n\\n     my enormous cat comes into the room  he runs right up to me and snuggles against me  he seems to be feeling very affectionate  he is huge and soft and his heavy breathing is soothing to the soul  his purrs murmur in the air  synesthetic vibrations of color buzzing above him like flies \\n\\ni am shaking a lot  this is all so so much more intense than i was expecting  the closed eyed visual space is absurd  cartoony  nonsensical and animated with waving  pulsing  dancing metallic forms with fields of tracers  swirling movement  cast in an orange backlight  everything  is reverberating and repeating itself into a higher frequency  everything is accelerating exponentially within my skull  with my eyes open  there are mostly just contours and concentric forms adorning every surface and object  they are basic and matter of fact yet also vivid and intense  some of the rings break off and bud and generate autonomous amorphous blobs that slowly drift around my field of vision like great psychedelic clouds  it’s hard to meditate on much or think about much  there isn’t a drive towards insight and introspection  it is mostly disorienting and confusing \\n\\ni try smoking a bit of cannabis to try and take the edge off of the nausea but i can’t kick it  everything is in constant motion  like sitting in a little boat that is being tossed about like a vicious storm \\n\\nthere is no euphoria  but there is a disquieting sense of presence  the experience is random and hard to comprehend but it feels intentional  like it is driven by the whims of some mad god  it is like sharing the room with a very large octopus that is staring right at me  there is intelligence and sentience there  but it is hidden under a veil of incomprehensible alien presence  a mind that has arisen from an entirely separate evolutionary lineage \\n\\n     my stomach still hurts a good bit  all i can really do is lie here and think about it  it’s hard to really think about anything else beyond my direct experience  the dizzying and spinning fantastic forms  the feelings of my body  my immediate surroundings as my senses can detect  i feel distant and detached  nothing in the house feels like a worthwhile occupation of my time  perhaps going for a walk will stir something in this experience \\n\\n     it is twilight  the sky glows a distant blue as the velvety night descends on the world  a mist hangs in the air  glowing in the last vestiges of sunlight  glowing with the beaming streetlights and houselights that begin to flicker on  the mist swirls and pulses around me  great concentric and contoured spheres rippled in chromatic iridescence \\n\\nthere was little fear or consternation in leaving the comfort of the house to be exposed in public  hardly anyone is out and about  i am cast with a grave indifference anyways  my head is too dissociated and spun out to worry about things or feel any stake in any sort of anxiety \\n\\nthe night is quiet but for a chorus of crickets  the same trees are cast over the same night sky i grew up with  where i once ran under their branches and picked up fallen sticks and swung them around i now nervously pace  the world rippling as i pass  i walk the same route i would take to elementary school from my house every day  well into my adulthood i could cut through my old school to avoid the winding suburban roads around it  but to my dismay i find the whole school has been locked down  with a high fence and a sturdy gate  i guess i can’t go back  this is a striking thing to see but i don’t dwell on it  all i can do is keep moving  what is the point of thinking even  falling into thought is just not something that concerns me in this state  all i can do is walk  experience  observe  catching snippets of conversations from people out on their own properties on this still and luscious gorgeous night  working on a car in their driveway  having a bonfire in the yard  pulling up and unloading groceries  a whole world alive and in motion around me  a sense of wonder is generated from this  a sensation of being one marble rolling down a hill amongst a multitude of other balls and marbles and spheres  all with a certain undeniable destination  all not knowing what interactions  experiences  collisions and separations will happen between each other as they face the unstoppable force of gravity \\n\\n     the land heaves a sigh  i walk to a park a few train stops down from my house and sit on a bench  it’s a cool night in the late summer so the night sounds are mostly just simple bush and field crickets  it’s a peaceful lullaby  it feels nice to sit still  there is no compulsion to move  there is little energy in my limbs  but there isn’t much compulsion to sit still either  i am content to just be here  experiencing this night  the sounds  the smells  the glistening taste of the humid air as a furious summer recedes  i am surrounded by darkness  but the visual effects that so flourished in the shadows have also for the most part receded  i am definitely more lucid now  my mind is taken into strings of thought and ponderance rather than the scrambled confusion it had to bear before  it feels nice to settle back into myself  this is a pleasant afterglow  i get a surprise phone call from someone who would not be pleased about me being on drugs  but i keep my composure and manage to sound sober through the phone  i feel sober too  i really don’t feel too far off baseline  this was such a brief experience  i wish i had people to interact with  even strangers to strike up friendly conversation with  but the streets are deserted and the only people i see seem engrossed in their tasks and probably don’t want to be disturbed \\n\\nas the drug recedes and coherency returns i feel haughty and arrogant  i want to present myself  display myself  show myself to the world  this self that i have spent a lifetime carefully crafting and assembling and patching together  an uncoordinated mishmash with no discernible core  but it can look pretty at the very least  but alas  there is no one  there is nothing  there is just me and the night and the trees  the lights of the town as i walk down the main street  families and bar regulars loitering on the sidewalks  indeed they are people but in this state they feel like set pieces  something to be ignored as they won’t feed into my solipsistic arrogance  what a dreadful person to be  perhaps it’s good that i don’t have anyone to talk to right now  i would make a fool of myself  i need to check myself  i should just go home \\n\\n     return home  i am almost back to baseline save for some residual stimulation and discomfort  this was a disorienting fireworks show  i am not sure if i gained anything meaningful from the last few hours though it was distinctly jarring  i idle around my house for a few hours  the comedown is a long and slow and steady plateau  the last echoes of such a lively and vibrant peak \\n\\n     entirely back to baseline\\n\\nconclusion    ho pipt was oddly intense in some respects  mild in others  the visual space was an explosion of forms and energy  great iridescent blue ripples with my eyes open and a world of vibrant metallic glowing forms  twisting and dancing with my eyes closed  it was overwhelming at points and made me content to be alone in my room for the peak  the headspace is odd  for the most part disorienting and confusing  there felt little space to ponder or introspect  i was taken by the sensory overload and was left in an empty daze  as the experience receded this was replaced by a pleasant mindfulness  a compulsion to be present and really only consider my immediate surroundings and circumstances  perhaps this phase of the experience could be of some value  though the peak was incomprehensible and offered little beyond novelty  the sheer alien ness of the experience allayed a lot of potential anxiety and hesitation  it was very easy to merely exist and be content with that fact  along for a ride in which i felt i had little control  surrendering to the experience felt like the right thing to do  the bodyload was heavy and unpleasant  particularly in a weighted nausea that persisted for most of the experience  it was remarkably short in duration  reaching the peak in under an hour and passing into the comedown just about     minutes after that  the comedown was a steady and lucid plateau with pleasant emotional effects  i was able to easily exist in public by that point  it is hard to draw comparisons to other tryptamines  it was perhaps reminiscent of the   substituted det analogues  in its short lasting and fiery intensity  the visuals were reminiscent of   ho dipt  and the gleefully esoteric headspace at times reminded me of dpt  but those are null comparisons if one hasn’t tried those drugs  ultimately it is a unique compound of its own  an interesting novelty that burns short and hot and bright and dazzles the brain ',\n",

       "  '6563': 'the reason i am writing this is because i read something in here along the lines of  research chemicals are basically pharma grade drugs in terms of purity   now  this is a very dangerous thinking  i am an organic chemist and biochemist and i have been working in the pharmaceutical industry for   years on the sourcing  qualification and testing of raw materials  so i wanted to just give you some reasons why  high purity  does not equal  pharma grade   that being said  i love my rc s as much as the rest of you  i just think it is good to know what you are really getting into besides the fact that those are drugs with little history of human use  \\n\\nso first of all  kinda obvious but don t believe everything you read on those rc shop sites   all our compound are lab tested and are     in purity   yeah my ass  some of them might be of very high purity  true  but not all  rc shops are usually supplied by bulk manufacturers  some of them are more trustworthy than others  but not all  and most rc shops can t be bothered to send samples to independent labs to verify the purity claims made by the manufacturers  \\n\\nnow let us assume that the      pure  claim is true  this does not mean that the product does not have nasty impurities  first of all  often the purity of a chemical is expressed as the purity  on dry basis   this means that you determine the purity of the substance by neglecting the presence of solvents in the calculation  let s say you have    of your substance mixed with    of nasty solvents and    of other impurities  then you could still validly say that you have    purity  dry basis   but the solvents are still in there \\n\\nanother thing to keep in mind is that    purity could still mean that you have    of very toxic impurities  especially elemental impurities such as mercury or lead that could be used as part of the manufacturing process and are toxic at very low concentrations  let s assume that you take   mg of a    powder  and the    impurity is mercury  this means that you ingest   mg of mercury which is quite a hefty dose  and those heavy metals tend to bioaccumulate so they stay in your system and add up over time  now granted this scenario is quite unlikely but i want you to get the general idea of why    purity does not equate to  safe from toxic dose of impurities  \\n\\nin the pharma industry  each raw material is not only tested for purity  but also for any potential impurity possibly present due to the manufacturing process  this includes heavy metals  residual solvents  leftover reagents and synthesis by products  just assaying the purity of a substance is far from enough to determine whether a product has the adequate quality for being used inside humans  and animals  \\n\\none last thing i would like to mention is the risk of cross contamination and mislabeling  to be able to consider a chemical to be  pharma grade   you not only have to prove that it has the adequate chemical purity  and absence of impurities   but also that it has been manufactured under proper conditions  with well defined procedures and full traceability at all times  this implies among others that you have to clean your equipment after each batch in such a way that no trace of your previous batch will be present in the next batch  this is ensured by demonstrating that your routine cleaning procedure removes all traces of whatever was present in your equipment and dedicating each piece of equipment to a single type product  obviously it is very expensive and time consuming  rc manufacturers aren t so thorough and the risk is real that you will get an rc a that has traces of super potent rc b in it  this has happened in the past  so it is not purely speculation on my part \\n\\nconcerning the risk of mis labeling  this risk is mitigated in the pharma industry by using multi level identification procedures which includes verification by at least two operators  automated scanning systems  physical segregation of different types of chemicals and batches  you only produce one product at a time in a given room  and so on  again  rc manufacturer and suppliers are not so serious about this  so it does happen that you get the wrong chemical which could be   times more potent than what you thought  i am looking at you  bromo dragonfly  \\n\\ni hope that this wall of text will help some of you be more careful in your research with those wonderful chemicals  major problems are rare but they do happen  so test your chemicals if you can and always start very low  rc s are not pharma grade chemicals ',\n",

forgot the weird uncertainty that tripping has to it  i’m drinking kratom rn \\n\\nt           am  at some point after smoking i was kinda pacing back and forth  and suddenly i like this slow motion feeling in my legs which i’ve felt before on thc  and has actually caused me to collapse in the past  i sat down on my friends bed after this because i didn’t want to risk collapsing  normally i would have been pretty freaked out but i was actually alright  i laid down on the second bed in the room and just stared the ceiling  there were color changing lights on the ceiling and it looked like the lights were shining thru water  i was also seeing this large firework mandala looking things on the ceiling  which had many colors but were primarily light green  this is probably the highest i was the whole night  the ceiling also started to look to me like the surface of an alien planet  because it wasn’t entirely flat  and in my mind the changes in height of the ceiling material looked like the surface of some other planet with civilizations living inside these visualized rocks and waging war against another  \\n\\nt          i’ve smoked multiple times now  really high but mentally not very heavy still  metocin seems to keep things okay and i feel less anxious than normal  there’s this weird sense of peace with this drug i like it a lot   i need to try to draw the vision i see on weed at high doses\\n\\nt          the feeling of peace i have is somewhat reminiscent of the feeling i’ve had on low doses of mdma  very peaceful and loving  feels like an empathogen  almost  i like this feeling a lot  weed complements it very well in comparison to other psychedelics  and i’m really surprised by the lack of anxiety and paranoia  provides the same amount of spaciness and an almost alien feeling  the visuals are really strong now  i definitely want to try much higher doses of metocin to see what the visuals and euphoria will be like  weed is very forgiving on this drug  i don’t know if i really noticed the kratom but that’s probably enhancing things a lot rn and reducing the anxiety a lot  alcohol may also have helped  i’ve drank two separate times  about three shots of vodka each time  i find myself wanting to get back to the original high a lot  i wish i was back at the peak   which happens to me a lot with mdma  i’m surprisingly focused as well  typing this trip report  i like the clear headedness  i feel like i could functional relatively well rn \\n\\nt          there’s almost a numbing of emotions  a lot of negative emotions seem super muted  i just feel a lot of peace and like a calm contentedness  \\n\\nt          still smoking  extending the high  i should definitely go to sleep pretty soon  \\n\\nt          a little bit too high  kinda just want to sleep rn but i can’t yet \\n\\nt          didn’t throw up  thought i would at like    i’m pretty tired but i’m still chillin  probably gonna sleep soon \\n\\nt          i’m still giggly as hell and have been all night  just laughing at everything  honestly kinda reminds me of how nitrous just makes me feel pretty dumb and laugh a lot for a few minutes  \\n\\nt          still high from hitting the pen a long ass time ago  before     i’m finally gonna go to sleep  stayed up a bit late but i had a fucking blast totally worth it  one of the best highs i’ve had in a long time \\n\\nt          i woke up at around    and i don’t feel high anymore but i definitely feel very elevated  still have a strong mood boost from last night  still feel pretty slow too  i didn’t sleep great bc i was still pretty high when i tried to sleep but at some point i passed out  i can’t remember if i had dreams but i’m pretty sure i did\\n\\nconclusion  i think that eating beforehand significantly reduced the effects of this drug  or am i just not very sensitive to it  the visuals were underwhelming until i added thc  but the headspace was a lot of fun  it felt very playful and forgiving  with a slight enpathogenic feel to it  which was pretty surprising to me  the end of the peak was a pretty abrupt feeling for me  as i suddenly felt almost entirely sober  this is when i added the kratom to the mix  which i never really felt hit exactly but i think it added to things overall  smoking really brought out the visuals and trippiness  i was feeling super spacey and the the visuals were a nice touch to it  the lack of anxiety really shocked me  as usually weed makes me extremely paranoid when i’m tripping  i definitely stayed up lately than i should have smoking  but i had a great time so it’s entirely worth it  i’m definitely gonna take a few weeks off from drugs after this trip  not because it was bad or intense  but just because i have a lot going on in life and i need to make sure i
