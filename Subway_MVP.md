## Analysis of NYC Subway Data

This project aimed to provide WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) with a list of subway stations that the organization can target with their street teams to collect email addresses. 

In order to make the list of subway stations the most actionable for the client, my methodology includes the following factors:

1) Subway station size as indicated by turnstile -> WTWY teams need to personally interact with commuters and a large station may not provide the best enviornment for one on one interaction. This analysis looks at medium sized stations, as defined by having between 12-32 turnstiles. 
2) Subway station foot traffic on a per-day basis -> This analysis aims to provide WTWY street teams with stations that are consistently busy.
3) Subway stations located in higher income zip codes & proximity to higher quality grocery stores -> This provides street teams with an opportunity to reach individuals that may donate to WTWY.
4) Subway stations located near universities -> This provides street teams with an opportunity to reach individuals that are interested in tech.

The figure depicts the model (red) plotted against the actual data points. The prediction interval is plotted in green.

This result suggests that budget may have a significant positive impact on a film's revenue. However, the magnitude of the model's residuals makes it clear that budget is not the only important factor in determining the success of a film.
