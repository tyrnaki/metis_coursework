## Analysis of NYC Subway Data

This project aimed to provide WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) with a list of subway stations that the organization can target with their street teams to collect email addresses. 

In order to make the list of subway stations the most actionable for the client, my methodology includes the following factors:

1) Subway station size as indicated by turnstile -> WTWY teams need to personally interact with commuters and a large station may not provide the best enviornment for one on one interaction. This analysis looks at medium sized stations, as defined by having between 12-32 turnstiles. 
2) Subway station foot traffic on a per-day basis -> This analysis aims to provide WTWY street teams with stations that are consistently busy.
3) Subway stations located in higher income zip codes & proximity to higher quality grocery stores -> This provides street teams with an opportunity to reach individuals that may donate to WTWY.
4) Subway stations located near universities -> This provides street teams with an opportunity to reach individuals that are interested in tech.

The map above highlights which subway stations (red icon) meet the four criteria. The blue icons represent universities while the green icons represent stores. The red circles around the red icons represent 1/4 mile radiuses, showing proximity to universities and stores.
