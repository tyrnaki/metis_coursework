This folder contains project work for the classification module of the course.

I used the following notebooks:
- [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/tyrnaki/metis_coursework/blob/main/COVID-19/COVID-19%20Data%20Reformatting.ipynb)
- [Testing Different Models](https://github.com/tyrnaki/metis_coursework/blob/main/COVID-19/Classification%20Sandbox.ipynb)
- [Testing Varieties of Logistic Regression Models](https://github.com/tyrnaki/metis_coursework/blob/main/COVID-19/Logistic%20Regression%20Sandbox.ipynb)

The underlying data can be found [here](https://github.com/tyrnaki/metis_coursework/blob/main/COVID-19/USA-data-categorical.csv).

Enjoy!
